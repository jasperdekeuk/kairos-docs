Today, it\'s running in large-scale, real-world deployments across diverse edge use cases. But more importantly\u2014it\'s been growing as a community.\\n\\nToday, we\'re excited to share a new milestone in that journey:  \\n\ud83d\udc49 **Kairos now has official commercial support options** available from [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support).\\n\\nBefore we dive into what that means, let\'s take a step back and talk about what makes an open-source project *reliable*\u2014especially when the stakes are high.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Makes Open Source Reliable?\\n\\nIn our view, there are two key ingredients that help teams adopt open source with confidence:\\n\\n### 1. **Good Governance**\\n\\nA mature open-source project needs a clear structure, transparency, and community direction. You want to know that decisions aren\'t made behind closed doors, and that the project will be around for the long term.\\n\\nWe\'re proud to say that [**Kairos achieved this last year**](https://kairos.io/blog/2024/10/08/kairos-joins-the-cncf-as-a-sandbox-project/), when it became a [CNCF Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). This step formalized our commitment to open governance and alignment with the broader cloud-native ecosystem.\\n\\nJoining the CNCF means more than just a badge\u2014it puts Kairos on a clear track for growth and maturity, with expectations around documentation, contributor diversity, quality, and more. We\'re not building in isolation\u2014we\'re growing with a strong open foundation.\\n\\n### 2. **Professional Support Options**\\n\\nEven the best community can\'t always meet the needs of production environments. Some organizations\u2014especially those in regulated industries or enterprise IT\u2014need a guaranteed path to support when something breaks.\\n\\nUntil now, support for Kairos has been best-effort, through GitHub issues, Slack discussions, and community help. That\'s still available, and it works well for many teams.\\n\\nBut for those who need enterprise-grade support, we now have an answer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Announcing Commercial Support for Kairos\\n\\nKairos now has **official enterprise-grade support options**, thanks to our support partner: [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support). As a major contributor and original creator of the project, Spectro Cloud is in a strong position to help organizations adopt Kairos with confidence.\\n\\nTheir support offerings range from basic ticketing-based assistance to full 24\xd77 production support, including hotfixes, CVE patching, onboarding, and SLAs. This is ideal for teams who want to standardize on Kairos at scale, and need more than community-based help.\\n\\nThis move does not change the open-source nature of the project\u2014Kairos remains 100% open, with no commercial forks or gated features. It simply expands the ecosystem and offers more choice to adopters.\\n\\n<div class=\\"buttons astro-7XAARZHW\\">\\n    <a id=\\"quickstart\\" href=\\"https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support\\" class=\\"astro-7XAARZHW\\">\\n        Learn more\\n    </a>\\n</div>\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why This Matters (Even If You Don\'t Need Support)\\n\\nYou might be thinking, \\"I use Kairos just fine without needing a support contract. Why should this matter to me?\u201d\\n\\nHere\'s why:\\n\\n- **It strengthens the project**. When support partners invest in Kairos, it helps sustain long-term development and community health.\\n- **It builds trust**. Organizations that rely on SLAs or need commercial assurances now have a clearer path to adoption.\\n- **It keeps options open**. Whether you\'re using Kairos as a solo developer or deploying across thousands of edge devices, you now have the flexibility to get help when you need it.\\n\\nOpen source isn\'t just about free (as in beer) software. It\'s about freedom\u2014of choice, of contribution, and of collaboration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nThis milestone is just one step in a broader journey.\\n\\nWe want to continue maturing Kairos and **reach CNCF Incubation**\u2014a critical next phase in the project\'s evolution. To do that, we need to keep growing the community, broadening adoption, and building deeper collaboration.\\n\\nSo we\'re putting out a call:\\n\\n\ud83d\udd14 **If you\'re a company invested in Kairos**, there are two key ways you can help:\\n\\n1. **Contribute Maintainers**  \\n   If you\'re already using Kairos in your products or infrastructure, chances are you\'re making improvements, tooling, or fixes internally. Why not share that value with the broader community? We invite you to become a maintainer, help guide the roadmap, and collaborate with us to shape the future of edge Linux together.\\n\\n2. **Become a Support Partner**  \\n   If you\'re recommending Kairos to your customers and helping them succeed with it, we\'d love to recognize your role. Let\'s work together to include your organization in our list of **Kairos support partners**\u2014making it clear that help is available from more than one source, and encouraging adoption from companies that want a trusted hand.\\n\\n\ud83d\udce9 **Interested? Reach out to us at [members@kairos.io](mailto:members@kairos.io)** to start the conversation.\\n\\nLet\'s continue building Kairos as an open, shared foundation\u2014one that scales with our collective ambition.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Try Kairos \u2014 and Get Help When You Need It\\n\\nIf you\'re exploring Kairos or already using it in production, we\'re here to support you\u2014both as a community and through professional channels.\\n\\nKairos now has **official enterprise-grade support partners**, for those who need additional help beyond the community. [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support), the original creator and a key maintainer of the project, is the first company to offer commercial support for Kairos.\\n\\nWe expect more organizations to join as support providers as adoption continues to grow.\\n\\nAs always, you can get involved with Kairos via [GitHub](https://github.com/kairos-io), our [Slack community](https://kairos.io/community), and other open channels. We welcome contributors, feedback, and discussion.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who\'s helped bring Kairos this far\u2014we\'re excited to keep improving it with you.\\n\\n\ud83e\udde1 The Kairos Maintainers"},{"id":"release-v3.5.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v3.5.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-25-release-v3.5.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-25-release-v3.5.0.md","title":"Kairos release v3.5.0","description":"Kairos release v3.5.0","date":"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":4.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kairos Team","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/kairos-io"},"url":"https://github.com/kairos-io","imageURL":"https://github.com/kairos-io.png","key":"kairos-team","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["kairos-team"],"description":"Kairos release v3.5.0","slug":"release-v3.5.0","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Kairos release v3.5.0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Growing Stronger: Introducing Commercial Support for Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/commercial-support-by-spectro-cloud"},"nextItem":{"title":"Kairos release v3.4.0","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v3.4.0"}},"content":"<h1 align=\\"center\\">\\n  <br />\\n     <img width=\\"184\\" alt=\\"kairos-white-column 5bc2fe34\\" src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/215073247-96988fd1-7fcf-4877-a28d-7c5802db43ab.png\\" />\\n    <br />\\n<br />\\n</h1>\\n\\n\\n\\n# \ud83d\ude80 Kairos 3.5.0: A Milestone for the Kairos Ecosystem\\n\\nWe\'re excited to announce the release of Kairos 3.5.0! This release represents a significant milestone for the broader Kairos ecosystem, marking the completion of several key features across multiple projects that work together to improve the overall Kairos experience.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## \u2699\ufe0f Meet the Kairos Operator\\n\\nThe biggest addition to the Kairos ecosystem is the **Kairos operator** - a standalone Kubernetes operator that provides a native way to manage upgrades and operations on Kairos nodes. While this operator can work with previous Kairos versions, 3.5.0 marks the point where we consider it mature enough to be the recommended approach for Kubernetes-based management.\\n\\nThe operator provides two custom resources:\\n\\n- **NodeOp**: For generic operations on Kubernetes nodes (Kairos or not). It allows mounting the host\'s root filesystem to perform operations or run scripts.\\n\\n- **NodeOpUpgrade**: A Kairos-specific custom resource for upgrading Kairos nodes. It automatically creates a NodeOp with the appropriate upgrade script and configuration.\\n\\nThis means you can now manage your Kairos nodes using familiar Kubernetes patterns. The operator automatically detects Kairos nodes and labels them with `kairos.io/managed: true`, making it easy to target Kairos nodes specifically in hybrid clusters.\\n\\nTo get started with the operator, simply deploy it to your cluster:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -k https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-operator/config/default\\n```\\n\\nThen trigger an upgrade by creating a NodeOpUpgrade resource:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: operator.kairos.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: NodeOpUpgrade\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kairos-upgrade\\n  namespace: default\\nspec:\\n  image: quay.io/kairos/ubuntu:22.04-standard-amd64-generic-v3.5.0-k3s-v1.33.2-k3s1\\n  nodeSelector:\\n    matchLabels:\\n      kairos.io/managed: \\"true\\"\\n  concurrency: 1\\n  stopOnFailure: true\\n```\\n\\nFor more details on using the operator, check out our [Kairos Operator documentation](/docs/upgrade/kairos-operator/).\\n\\nThe Kairos operator opens up new possibilities for node management. You can now:\\n\\n- Perform custom operations on nodes using NodeOp resources\\n- Control upgrade concurrency and failure handling\\n- Apply configuration changes after installation\\n- Reset nodes with custom configurations\\n- Handle trusted boot upgrades through Kubernetes\\n\\nThe operator provides fine-grained control over deployment strategies, allowing you to implement canary deployments, rolling updates, or bulk operations depending on your needs.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Enhanced AuroraBoot Experience\\n\\nAnother significant milestone is the completion of the API-based workflow in [AuroraBoot](https://github.com/kairos-io/AuroraBoot), our tool for building bootable images. AuroraBoot provides a comprehensive solution for creating custom bootable images, with both a user-friendly WebUI and powerful automation capabilities.\\n\\n### Introducing AuroraBoot WebUI\\n\\nAuroraBoot includes a web-based interface that makes image building accessible to everyone. The WebUI provides an intuitive way to configure and build custom Kairos images without needing to remember complex command-line parameters. You can easily specify container images, cloud configurations, and various build options through a clean, modern interface.\\n\\n:::warning Experimental Feature\\n\\nThe AuroraBoot WebUI is currently under heavy development and should be considered experimental. While functional, it may have limitations and could undergo significant changes in future releases. For production use, we recommend using the command-line interface.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nTo get started with the AuroraBoot WebUI, simply run:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\\\\n           --privileged \\\\\\n           -v $PWD/build/:/output \\\\\\n           -p 8080:8080 \\\\\\n           quay.io/kairos/auroraboot web\\n```\\n\\nThen visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to access the interface. For more details on using the WebUI, check out our [AuroraBoot documentation](/docs/reference/auroraboot/).\\n\\n### API-Based Automation\\n\\nThe new API-based workflow in AuroraBoot enables automation of image building operations. This means you can now integrate image building into your CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation workflows. The API provides programmatic access to all AuroraBoot features, allowing you to build images as part of your automated deployment processes.\\n\\nThe API workflow complements the existing WebUI, giving you both the ease of use for manual operations and the power of automation for production environments.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Configuration Path Migration Reminder\\n\\nWhile [the configuration path change](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2233) from `/etc/elemental/config.yaml` to `/etc/kairos/config.yaml` has been moved to v4.0.0, we want to remind users to start migrating their configurations now. This change will align our configuration paths with the Kairos branding and provide a cleaner, more consistent experience.\\n\\nIf you\'re using the old path, we recommend updating your configurations to use the new location (`/etc/kairos/config.yaml`) to prepare for deprecation. The old path will continue to work for now, but migrating early will ensure a smooth transition.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd2e What\'s Next\\n\\nThe completion of these ecosystem features represents a significant step toward more integrated and automated Kairos workflows. We\'re excited to see how the community uses these new capabilities to build more sophisticated deployment and management workflows.\\n\\nWe\'re already working on the next milestone - [Kairos v3.6.0](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2990). Check out the ticket to see what\'s coming next.\\n\\nAs always, we encourage you to try out the new features and share your feedback. Whether you\'re upgrading existing clusters, automating image builds, or deploying new ones, these tools should make your day-to-day operations smoother and more predictable.\\n\\nFor a complete list of changes in this release, visit the [v3.5.0 release page on GitHub](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v3.5.0).

Kairos 3.4.0 is one of those releases.\\n\\nIn the last few months, we\u2019ve been heads-down rethinking what makes Kairos powerful, approachable, and future-proof. The result is a foundational overhaul: a brand-new build system, native images for all major cloud providers, streamlined customization through system extensions, and a tighter Kubernetes story with built-in support for k0s. This release isn\u2019t just packed with features\u2014it reflects where the project is heading and how our community is shaping that direction.\\n\\nLet\u2019s walk through the biggest milestones in Kairos 3.4.0, how they work, and why they matter.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Rebuilding Kairos from the Ground Up with `kairos-init`\\n\\nWe\u2019ve officially said goodbye to Earthly and rebuilt the Kairos build system from scratch. The new system, centered around `kairos-init`, is faster, cleaner, and deeply inspired by the declarative configuration model we\u2019ve honed through Yip.\\n\\n> \u201cWe didn\u2019t just want to make the build system better\u2014we wanted to make it understandable and hackable.\u201d \u2014 from [our deep dive](https://kairos.io/blog/2025/03/26/how-we-rebuilt-kairos-building-from-the-ground-up/)\\n\\nThis change makes it easier than ever to create your own derivative OS with Kairos. If you\u2019re customizing images or building new flavors, the [`kairos-factory` documentation](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/kairos-factory/) is your new best friend. It\u2019s built for composability, consistency, and speed.\\n\\n## \u2601\ufe0f Kairos Goes Native on the Cloud\\n\\nWith 3.4.0, Kairos now offers **official cloud images** for AWS, Azure, and GCP. That means you can deploy Kairos right from your cloud console\u2014no manual image imports, no extra setup.\\n\\n- [Launch on AWS](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/aws/)\\n- [Deploy via Azure Marketplace](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/azure/)\\n- [Spin up on GCP](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/gce/)\\n\\nThis makes it easier to integrate Kairos into hybrid, multi-cloud, or CI-driven workflows\u2014and aligns with our goal to make Kairos ready-to-go for every environment.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Kubernetes with k0s: The Meta-Distribution Vision\\n\\nWith native support for [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/), Kairos is now a **meta-distribution for Kubernetes**\u2014fully declarative, fully integrated. Whether you\'re deploying edge nodes or building HA clusters, k0s + Kairos is a minimal, clean foundation.\\n\\nYou can now toggle between k3s and k0s setups in the updated docs and configure each using the same Kairos cloud-init model.  \\n\ud83d\udc49 [Blog deep dive](https://kairos.io/blog/2025/04/02/kairos-meets-k0s-a-meta-distribution-for-kubernetes-is-born/)\\n\\n## \ud83e\udde9 Live Customization with System Extensions\\n\\nSay goodbye to image rebuilds for small tweaks. System extensions let you declaratively **add or modify behavior on a running Kairos system**, and 3.4.0 ships with built-in CLI support to install, remove, enable, and disable extensions.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 [Learn more](https://kairos.io/blog/2025/04/15/system-extensions-simplified-live-customization-with-kairos/)  \\n\ud83d\udc49 [System Extensions docs](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/sys-extensions/)\\n\\nThis opens the door to layered, profile-based systems that evolve post-deployment\u2014great for both immutable infrastructure and rapidly changing environments.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4c New Contributor Shout-Out\\n\\nHuge thanks to **@jimmycathy** for their first contribution to the project! \ud83c\udf89  \\nPR: https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/pull/3255\\n\\nWe\u2019re always excited to welcome new contributors. Whether it\u2019s documentation, ideas, or PRs\u2014every bit helps make Kairos stronger for everyone.\\n\\n---\\n\\nStay tuned as we continue evolving Kairos with your feedback and use cases in mind.

You had to mount things yourself, know where to drop files, and keep track of boot profiles by hand.\\n\\nThat\u2019s all changed.\\n\\nYou can now:\\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Download** raw extension images over `https`, `file`, or even `oci` (alpha)\\n- \u2705 **Enable or disable** extensions declaratively per boot profile\\n- \u26a1 **Activate extensions live** with `--now`\\n- \ud83d\udd0d **List** which extensions are installed or currently active\\n- \ud83e\uddf9 **Remove** extensions safely\u2014links and all\\n\\nAll from one CLI entrypoint:\\n\\n```bash\\nkairos-agent sysext\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f How It Works\\n\\nUnder the hood, the new system works using a simple but powerful layout:\\n\\n| Path                                | What it does                                |\\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\\n| `/var/lib/kairos/extensions/`       | Stores downloaded disk images               |\\n| `.../active`, `.../passive`, etc.   | Symlink folders tied to boot profiles       |\\n| `/run/extensions/`                  | Where active sysexts live at runtime        |\\n\\nWhen the system boots, **`immucore`** checks the current boot profile and links the relevant extensions into `/run/extensions/`, which are then loaded by **`systemd-sysext`**.\\n\\nIt\u2019s all ephemeral, safe, and declarative.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd10 Compatible with Trusted Boot\\n\\nSystem security remains a top priority in Kairos. If you\u2019re using **Trusted Boot**, rest assured: this new extension mechanism doesn\'t compromise your system\'s integrity.\\n\\nOnly **signed and trusted extension images** are allowed to load. This means:\\n- The bootloader and init system verify authenticity\\n- Unsigned or tampered images are simply ignored\\n- Your measured boot chain remains intact and auditable\\n\\nSo yes\u2014you can safely extend your system at runtime *without sacrificing security*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Real-World Usage\\n\\nHere\u2019s what it looks like in action:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Download a disk image directly\\nkairos-agent sysext download https://example.org/extensions/mytool.img\\n\\n# Enable it for active boots, and load it now\\nkairos-agent sysext enable --active --now mytool\\n\\n# See what\u2019s active\\nkairos-agent sysext list --active\\n\\n# Remove it completely\\nkairos-agent sysext remove --now mytool\\n```\\n\\nAnd yes\u2014**you don\u2019t need to type full names**.

If you wanted something else? You had to rely on community-powered providers. And let\u2019s be honest, while amazing in their own right, they\u2019ve been... fragmented.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen providers emerge for `kubeadm`, `nodeadm`, `microk8s`, and even another flavor of `k3s`. Each one added the ability to run Kubernetes on Kairos, but they were often self-contained efforts. Most didn\u2019t plug into our cloud-init-style configuration, which meant you had to know your way around their specific setup to get them running. Power users and contributors made them work, but new users? Not so much.\\n\\nThen there\u2019s the [`provider-kairos`](https://github.com/kairos-io/provider-kairos), which offers a consistent configuration layer across setups and makes Kubernetes orchestration a breeze, especially for decentralized, peer-to-peer deployments powered by EdgeVPN. But it had one limitation: it only worked with `k3s`.\\n\\nThat is... until now.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Enter k0s: The Zero Friction Kubernetes\\n\\nA few months back, [William Rizzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-rizzo/), a CNCF and Linkerd Ambassador, approached us with a pull request and a mission: bring `k0s` to Kairos with the same first-class integration as `k3s`.\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar, [k0s](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/) is a lightweight, CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that bundles everything into a single binary. No OS dependencies. No frills. Just Kubernetes, as it should be \u2014 simple to run, easy to maintain, and friendly across bare metal, cloud, edge, and IoT. It supports containerd, Kube-Router by default (with optional Calico), and can run anywhere Linux does. It\u2019s perfect for Kairos.\\n\\nWe sat down together and made it happen. This is the magic of open-source: two CNCF Sandbox Projects, [Kairos](https://kairos.io) and [k0s](https://k0sproject.io), coming together to build something bigger than either could alone.\\n\\nNow, thanks to this collaboration, you can run `k0s` using the same Kairos-native cloud-init configuration that previously only supported `k3s`. That means P2P cluster formation with EdgeVPN, full configuration via YAML, and all the DX goodness you\u2019re used to, with a new Kubernetes engine under the hood.\\n\\n## What This Means\\n\\nKairos just leveled up.\\n\\nWe\u2019re not just a Linux meta-distribution anymore. We\u2019re taking our first real steps into becoming a Kubernetes *meta*-distribution.\\n\\nSo meta.\\n\\n![Always has been](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe0fe0c-7962-4dad-9c27-cf6aab23af11)\\n\\nFrom now on, users don\u2019t have to choose between clean, declarative setups and their preferred Kubernetes flavor. The Kairos provider now supports both `k3s` *and* `k0s` natively. Want to try it? We\u2019ve added [examples](https://kairos.io/docs/examples/) to our repository showing both side-by-side so you can pick the flavor that suits your use case best.\\n\\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. As noted in the recent [CNCF blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/25/building-secure-kubernetes-edge-images-with-kairos-and-k0s/), combining `k0s`\u2019s single-binary simplicity with Kairos\u2019s secure, immutable images is a huge win for edge computing. Together, we\u2019re making it easier to build secure-by-default, production-ready clusters from the ground up.\\n\\n## Try it Today\\n\\nThe `k0s` integration will be fully stable in Kairos `v3.4`, but you don\u2019t have to wait. It\u2019s already available in our beta or nightly images for [Ubuntu](https://quay.io/repository/kairos/ubuntu), [Rockylinux](https://quay.io/repository/kairos/rockylinux), and [openSUSE](https://quay.io/repository/kairos/opensuse), or you can [build your own with AuroraBoot](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/build/#auroraboot).\\n\\nTo get started:\\n\\n- Check out the [Kairos provider repository](https://github.com/kairos-io/provider-kairos)\\n- Explore the updated examples with `k3s` and `k0s`\\n- Spin up a custom image\\n- And let us know what you build!"},{"id":"kairos-init-announcement","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/kairos-init-announcement","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2025-03-26-kairos-init-announcement.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-26-kairos-init-announcement.md","title":"How We Rebuilt Kairos building From the Ground Up","description":"\ud83e\uddf1 Introduction","date":"2025-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":6.15,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Itxaka Serrano","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/itxaka"},"url":"https://github.com/itxaka","imageURL":"https://github.com/itxaka.png","key":"itxaka-serrano","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["itxaka-serrano"],"slug":"kairos-init-announcement","tags":["kairos"],"title":"How We Rebuilt Kairos building From the Ground Up"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Kairos Meets k0s: A Meta-Distribution for Kubernetes is Born","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/kairos-meets-k0s"},"nextItem":{"title":"How I Automated My Doorbell with Kairos (and You Can Too)","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/kairos-doorbell"}},"content":"## \ud83e\uddf1 Introduction\\n\\nBuilding Kairos has always been about more than assembling images \u2014 it\'s about shaping a flexible, powerful OS tailored for the edge. Over the past couple of years, we\'ve learned a lot while navigating how to build and maintain Kairos across a growing list of base distributions, architectures, and board-specific targets.\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to introduce something that marks a turning point in how Kairos is built: **`kairos-init`**.\\n\\nThis post isn\'t just about a new tool. It\u2019s about simplifying complexity, rediscovering clarity, and embedding hard-earned lessons into something lean and extensible. If you\'ve followed our journey, you\'ll know that we\'ve gone from Dockerfiles to Earthly, and now to a new approach centered on declarative simplicity with Yip.\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll take you behind the scenes:\\n- Why the old ways worked (until they didn\u2019t)\\n- How we outgrew our tooling\\n- What `kairos-init` changes \u2014 and why it matters\\n\\nThis is the story of how we rebuilt the foundation of Kairos, one layer at a time.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc33 The Early Days: Building with Dockerfiles\\n\\nWhen Kairos first took shape, our needs were simple. We wanted a predictable, repeatable way to turn a base Linux distribution into a fully working Kairos image. And at the time, the most straightforward path was through a set of handcrafted **Dockerfiles** \u2014 one for each supported base.\\n\\nNeed Kairos on Ubuntu? There was a Dockerfile for that. OpenSUSE? Another one. Want to tweak something for a Raspberry Pi or test an Alpine variant? Copy, paste, modify.\\n\\nThis worked \u2014 until it didn\u2019t.\\n\\nAt first, it was empowering. We could iterate quickly, test changes, and get a Kairos image up and running in no time. Each Dockerfile acted like a scriptable recipe for image creation. But as we started expanding support for more:\\n- \ud83e\uddf1 **Distributions** (Ubuntu 24.04, 22.04, 20.04, OpenSUSE, Alpine, Rocky, Fedora\u2026)\\n- \ud83d\udce6 **Releases** (LTS, rolling, and experimental flavors across versions)\\n- \u2699\ufe0f **Architectures** (x86_64, ARM64)\\n- \ud83d\udce6 **Boards and platforms** (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, cloud providers\u2026)\\n\\n\u2026 the number of Dockerfiles exploded.\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/img/init-1.png\\" alt=\\"Kairos Dockerfiles in the wild (Version 2.3.0)\\" />\\n  <br />\\n  <em>Kairos Dockerfiles in the wild (Version 2.3.0)</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n_Kairos Dockerfiles in the wild (Version 2.3.0)_\\n\\nMaintaining them became a slow grind. Every distro had its quirks. Every version bump required tweaks. Repeating common steps across files introduced subtle bugs. And worst of all, it was hard to scale \u2014 we were reinventing the same process in N different places, each slightly different, each easy to break.\\n\\nWe needed a better way.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf0d Scaling Painfully: Enter Earthly\\n\\nAs the number of supported distros, architectures, and boards grew, so did the pain of managing our Dockerfiles. It wasn\u2019t just about duplication anymore \u2014 it was about orchestration, coordination, and staying sane across a forest of moving parts.\\n\\nSo we took the next step and adopted **[Earthly](https://earthly.dev/)**.\\n\\nEarthly gave us a powerful framework to unify and modularize our builds. Instead of one Dockerfile per case, we could define reusable steps, build pipelines, and cache logic across flavors and platforms. It brought real structure to our chaos.\\n\\nWith Earthly, we gained:\\n- \ud83d\udd01 **Reusable modules** for common build logic\\n- \ud83e\udde9 **Parameterized builds** across distros and versions\\n- \ud83e\udde0 **Smarter caching**, which cut build times drastically\\n- \ud83e\udd16 **Better CI integration**, especially in GitHub Actions\\n- \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **Cross-architecture support** (building ARM images from x86 machines)\\n\\nIt was a massive improvement. Kairos became easier to scale, easier to extend, and more robust in CI/CD pipelines. We could merge several Dockerfiles into a single one for that given Flavor and make earthly trigger the right steps based on the target architecture or version.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/img/init-2.png\\" alt=\\"Less lines is always better, right? (Version 3.3.1)\\" />\\n  <br />\\n  <em>Less lines is always better, right? (Version 3.3.1)</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nBut the cost of complexity caught up with us.\\n\\nEarthly was powerful, but also heavy. Setting up the environment required more tooling and context. Onboarding new contributors meant explaining layers of build abstraction. And eventually, even Earthly couldn\u2019t fully hide the fact that we were fighting the complexity we had slowly built up.\\n\\nAs our use cases expanded \u2014 with more devices, more customization, more flavors \u2014 our build logic became a tangled web of conditionals and overrides.\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/img/init-3.png\\" alt=\\"The Earthly pipeline grows instead (Version 3.3.1)\\" />\\n  <br />\\n  <em>The Earthly pipeline grows instead (Version 3.3.1)</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nWe needed a reset. A system built from the start for clarity and adaptability.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udde8 Reaching the Breaking Point\\n\\nBy this stage, we had all the signs of a powerful yet brittle system.\\n\\nEvery new board support request \u2014 whether for a Jetson device, RPi variant, or some obscure industrial box \u2014 meant another round of \u201chow do we fit this into the Earthly pipeline without breaking 10 other things?\u201d Even small changes to the build logic carried unintended ripple effects. Maintenance became a game of regression whack-a-mole.\\n\\nOur internal complexity had quietly outpaced the benefits of our tooling.\\n\\n- We were juggling **multiple abstraction layers**\\n- Supporting a new architecture meant rewriting or extending **multiple Earthfiles**\\n- Troubleshooting builds required context-switching between tools and environments\\n- Most importantly, it became **hard for contributors to participate**\\n\\nThat\u2019s when we stopped and asked: *What if we could start fresh?*\\n\\nThe answer was `kairos-init`.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f We Tried Other Tools First\\n\\nBefore diving into `kairos-init`, we explored other tools and frameworks hoping to find a better fit. But none of them quite matched the specific constraints of our ecosystem \u2014 building across multiple distros, versions, and architectures in a consistent, maintainable way.\\n\\nSo, we did what every developer dreams of: we built our own.\\n\\n## \u2728 The Breakthrough: `kairos-init` and Yip\\n\\n`kairos-init` is a CLI tool that encapsulates everything needed to transform **any base Linux image** into a fully Kairos system \u2014 with nothing more than a standard `Dockerfile`.\\n\\nBy running `kairos-init BUILD` in a Dockerfile, it:\\n- Inspects the base image\\n- Generates a Yip configuration\\n- Executes that config to:\\n  - Install necessary packages\\n  - Add the Kairos framework (binaries, configs, init hooks)\\n  - Patch the initramfs\\n  - Link kernel files\\n  - Apply any workarounds or tweaks\\n\\nThe result is a container image that\u2019s Kairos-ready \u2014 no extra steps, no complex layering.\\n\\nYou can then:\\n- Use it as an **upgrade image**\\n- Extend it with Kubernetes runtimes like `k3s` or `k0s` using flags\\n- Convert it into various formats with [AuroraBoot](https://github.com/kairos-io/AuroraBoot):\\n  - ISO\\n  - Raw image\\n  - Cloud image\\n  - PXE bootable\\n  - EFI Unified System Image\\n\\nAnd because it\u2019s just a Dockerfile, it drops right into any existing workflow:\\n- CI/CD pipelines\\n- Local testing\\n- Version-controlled infra repos\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf24 A Cleaner Future\\n\\nWith `kairos-init`, we\u2019ve:\\n- Simplified builds down to one step\\n- Removed the need for Earthly or complex pipelines\\n- Made Kairos accessible to new contributors and integrators\\n- Enabled future growth without growing technical debt\\n\\nWe\u2019re no longer managing complexity \u2014 we\u2019ve replaced it with clarity.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd2d What\u2019s Next\\n\\nWhat\u2019s ahead:\\n- More `kairos-init` examples and docs\\n- Deep dives on Yip\\n- Custom build guides\\n- Community use cases\\n\\nWe\u2019re also eager to hear how **you** use it \u2014 tag us, open issues, or just say hi.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udded Conclusion\\n\\nFrom handcrafted Dockerfiles to Earthly-powered pipelines and now to a clean, declarative build system \u2014 this journey has been about making Kairos better not just for us, but for you.\\n\\nWith `kairos-init`, we\u2019ve laid the groundwork for a more open, composable, and hackable future.\\n\\nThanks for building with us. \ud83d\ude80"},{"id":"kairos-doorbell","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/kairos-doorbell","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2025-03-18-kairos-doorbell.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-18-kairos-doorbell.md","title":"How I Automated My Doorbell with Kairos (and You Can Too)","description":"Picture this: You\u2019re deep in focus, coding away, and the doorbell rings.

It\u2019s using the D780 transformer with the following connection (diagram on the left of the picture).\\n\\n![Diagram of a Honeywell D117 doorbell with a D780 transformer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fbdd893-dba4-496e-9bbc-6450418d5eb4)\\n\\n\\nThe transformer takes 220V and produces an 8V current\\n\\n![Transformer D780](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da048846-16f8-41ca-8673-1467a1028fa3)\\n\\nWe can now use a relay to detect when the circuit is closed. I wasn\u2019t able to find an 8V AC relay, so I tried with a 12V AC and a 6V AC. The 12V one didn\'t work but the 6V one did. I cannot tell how bad an idea this is so only try this at your own risk. The brand is FINDER and the part number is `40.52.8.006.0000`, I bought it from [Reichelt](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/shop/produkt/steckrelais_2x_um_250v_8a_6vac_rm_5_0mm-271335) and got it sent to Belgium\\n\\nConnect `A1` and `A2` to `0F` and `T3` respectively.\\n\\n![Doorbell Wiring](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1afd596-60ef-4181-92c3-250af52693a3)\\n\\nWe will use the always open circuit on the other side of the relay so connect a male to female cable on 11 and 14 which will go to the Raspberry Pi.\\n\\n![Relay Wiring](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aac2983-3208-4792-a14e-713afea7bd0d)\\n\\nI connected it to [GPIO 23](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin16_gpio23/) and [Ground (14)](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/ground)\\n\\n![RPi Wiring](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10b4573-dc3d-478c-9853-07abbafaef8c)\\n\\n## Software\\n\\n### System Image\\n\\nNow that all the cabling is done, let\u2019s prepare the software. First I\u2019m going to prepare the image for the SD card. For that I\u2019ll use Kairos because it will make it easier for me to do upgrades in the future and because it\u2019s immutable so I can have my infrastructure as code easily. All I have to do is build a raw image which I can then copy to the SD card.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --rm --privileged \\\\\\n  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\\\\n  -v $PWD/build/:/output \\\\\\n  quay.io/kairos/auroraboot:latest \\\\\\n  --debug \\\\\\n  --set \\"disable_http_server=true\\" \\\\\\n  --set \\"disable_netboot=true\\" \\\\\\n  --set \\"container_image=quay.io/kairos/opensuse:leap-15.6-standard-arm64-rpi4-v3.3.1-k3sv1.32.1-k3s1\\" \\\\\\n  --set \\"state_dir=/output\\" \\\\\\n  --set \\"disk.raw=true\\"\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot in this command, which you can learn in the Kairos documentation but the one important thing to know is that I\u2019m consuming the Kairos image that is specially built for Raspberry Pi 4 and that it contains the K3s Kubernetes distribution in it so I can deploy my script via Kubernetes and leave the base image unchanged.\\n\\nIf everything is successful you should get the image `build/kairos-opensuse-leap-15.6-standard-arm64-rpi4-v3.3.1-k3s1.32.1.raw` so let\u2019s copy it into the SD card, I\u2019m on Linux so I can run the following\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo dd if=./build/kairos-opensuse-leap-15.6-standard-arm64-rpi4-v3.3.1-k3s1.32.1.raw \\\\\\n  of=/dev/mmblk0 \\\\\\n  oflag=sync \\\\\\n  status=progress \\\\\\n  bs=10MB\\n```\\n\\nOnce it finishes copying, you can insert it on the Raspberry Pi and boot it. It will do an initial boot to setup the system and reboot on its own. In the meantime let\u2019s prepare the software we are going to deploy.\\n\\n### Telegram Bot\\n\\nI will be using a telegram bot to send the messages. This way anyone in the family can subscribe to it and mute it if they want. If you prefer a different solution just adapt the Python script in the next section.\\n\\n1. Open Telegram and search for BotFather.\\n2. Type /newbot and follow the steps to create a bot.\\n3. Copy the API token that BotFather gives you.\\n4. Interact with your bot by sending any message\\n5. Extract the Chat ID by going to a browser using the api token you got in one of the previous steps https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_API_TOKEN/getUpdates\\n\\n### Python Script\\n\\nThis script will detect when there\u2019s a signal in GPIO 23, write a log and send a Telegram message\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport lgpio as GPIO\\nimport time\\nimport requests\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\n# Read environment variables\\nBOT_TOKEN = os.environ.get(\\"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\\")\\nCHAT_ID = os.environ.get(\\"TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID\\")\\n\\n# GPIO Setup\\nGPIO_PIN = 23\\nh = GPIO.gpiochip_open(0)\\nGPIO.gpio_claim_input(h, GPIO_PIN, GPIO.SET_PULL_UP)\\n\\ndef send_telegram_message(message):\\n    if not BOT_TOKEN or not CHAT_ID:\\n        print(\\"\u274c Error: Missing environment variables for Telegram bot.\\")\\n        return\\n    url = f\\"<https://api.telegram.org/bot{BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage>\\"\\n    payload = {\\"chat_id\\": CHAT_ID, \\"text\\": message}\\n    requests.post(url, json=payload)\\n\\nprint(\\"\ud83d\ude80 Doorbell monitor started...\\")\\nwhile True:\\n    if GPIO.gpio_read(h, GPIO_PIN) == 0:  # Button pressed\\n        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\")\\n        message = f\\"\ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at {timestamp}!\\"\\n        print(f\\"[{timestamp}] \ud83d\udd14 {message}\\")\\n        send_telegram_message(message)\\n        time.sleep(2)  # Avoid spamming messages\\n    time.sleep(0.1)\\n```\\n\\n### Dockerfile\\n\\nWe won\u2019t run the script directly on the Raspberry Pi, it will be running in a Docker container. This is very useful when having the underlying system be immutable because I can still iterate without having to rebuild and burn a new SD card and restart the system. Instead all I have to do is install the packages I need in this container and run it in privilege mode. This of course can open some security risks, but again, this is just for learning purposes and for fun.\\n\\n```dockerfile\\n# Use a lightweight Python base image for Raspberry Pi (ARM)\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Install system dependencies\\nRUN apt update && apt install -y python3-dev gcc\\n\\nRUN pip install lgpio requests\\n\\n# Set the working directory inside the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the Python script into the container\\nCOPY doorbell.py /app/doorbell.py\\n\\n# Set the script to run on startup\\nCMD [\\"python3\\", \\"/app/doorbell.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nSince the image is going to be running on the Raspberry Pi but I\u2019m going to build it on an AMD platform, then I need to cross-compile. Use any tag you prefer, just keep in mind it is the same tag you have to use in the deployment in the next section\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 \\\\\\n  -t quay.io/mauromorales/doorbell:telegram-v1 \\\\\\n  .\\n```\\n\\nAnd publish it to a repository, I\u2019m using Quay but you can use any repo you prefer\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker push quay.io/mauromorales/doorbell:telegram-v1\\n```\\n\\nYes that image is public and will remain static, but I\u2019d recommend you build your own instead of using mine because at any moment I might decide to remove it.\\n\\n### Kubernetes\\n\\nLast piece of the puzzle is the Kubernetes deployment. Let\u2019s log into our Kairos system with user `kairos` and password `kairos`\\n\\n```bash\\nssh kairos@IP\\n```\\n\\nSwitch to root\\n\\n```\\nsudo -i\\n```\\n\\nWe want to create some secrets and pass them as environment variables in the container. Take the telegram bot token and chat id and encode them. For example if my Chat ID is `1234567890` then I\u2019d do as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\necho -n \\"1234567890\\" | base64\\n```\\n\\ndo the same with the bot token, e.g. if my bot token was `999999999:FooooooBaaaaaaaaR` then I\u2019d do\\n\\n```bash\\necho -n \\"999999999:FooooooBaaaaaaaaR\\" | base64\\n```\\n\\nand copy them in a file called `telegram-secrets.yaml` and add the following content (remember to replace with your actual encoded values). Yes Kairos is immutable in some areas but the home directory is writable.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n  name: telegram-secrets\\ntype: Opaque\\ndata:\\n  bot_token: OTk5OTk5OTk5OkZvb29vb29CYWFhYWFhYWFS\\n  chat_id: MTIzNDU2Nzg5MA==\\n```\\n\\nSave the file and apply it\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f telegram-secret.yaml\\n```\\n\\nNow we create a `deployment.yaml` file to connect everything together\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: rpi-doorbell\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 1\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:\\n      app: doorbell\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      labels:\\n        app: doorbell\\n    spec:\\n      containers:\\n      - name: doorbell\\n        image: quay.io/mauromorales/doorbell:telegram-v1\\n        imagePullPolicy: Always   # Forces Kubernetes to always pull the latest image\\n        securityContext:\\n          privileged: true  # Allows access to GPIO hardware\\n        resources:\\n          limits:\\n            memory: \\"128Mi\\"\\n            cpu: \\"100m\\"\\n        env:\\n          - name: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\\n            valueFrom:\\n              secretKeyRef:\\n                name: telegram-secrets\\n                key: bot_token\\n          - name: TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID\\n            valueFrom:\\n              secretKeyRef:\\n                name: telegram-secrets\\n                key: chat_id\\n```\\n\\nAnd apply it\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f deployment.yaml\\n```\\n\\nIf everything went as expected, you should see your pod running\\n\\n```\\nlocalhost:~ # kubectl get pods\\nNAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nrpi-doorbell-67c78c5969-s6pw8   1/1     Running   0          20h\\n```\\n\\nAnd you can get logs from that pod tracking every time someone pressed your doorbell in addition to sending the Telegram message\\n\\n```\\nlocalhost:~ # kubectl logs rpi-doorbell-67c78c5969-s6pw8\\n\ud83d\ude80 Doorbell monitor started...\\n[2025-03-05 13:51:34] \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at 2025-03-05 13:51:34!\\n[2025-03-05 15:41:25] \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at 2025-03-05 15:41:25!\\n[2025-03-05 15:42:13] \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at 2025-03-05 15:42:13!\\n[2025-03-05 18:28:26] \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at 2025-03-05 18:28:26!\\n[2025-03-06 09:59:18] \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udeaa Doorbell pressed at 2025-03-06 09:59:18!\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith this setup me and my partner can subscribe to the Telegram Bot and get notifications to our phones. I can also mute the bot if I\u2019m in a meeting and don\u2019t want to be disturbed. I could extend the system to not notify at certain hours of the day but still keep logs. If I\u2019m not happy with Telegram then I can connect it to a different system. Whenever there\u2019s a new version of Kairos I can upgrade the system remotely via the command line or through Kubernetes. If you have a similar setup but don\u2019t want to buy a smart doorbell just yet, I can only recommend this setup.\\n\\n![Telegram Bot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c86d85e4-86b5-465d-bf1a-83a8850916bc)"},{"id":"cncf-sandbox-project","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/cncf-sandbox-project","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-10-08-cncf-sandbox-project.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-08-cncf-sandbox-project.md","title":"Kairos Joins the CNCF as a Sandbox Project","description":"We\u2019re thrilled to announce that since April 2024, Kairos has been officially part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox Project.

This marks an important milestone for Kairos and, more importantly, for our entire community of users and contributors.\\n\\nYou might be wondering - what does being part of the CNCF mean for you? The CNCF is known for backing the most innovative, reliable, and secure projects in the cloud-native space, and having their support brings a number of crucial benefits. Let\u2019s dive into why this matters.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Stability and Long-Term Support\\n\\nFirst and foremost, being part of the CNCF ensures that Kairos is built to last. The CNCF provides a stable and structured environment that safeguards against a project disappearing overnight, something that can be a concern for open-source users. With CNCF backing us, you can rest assured that Kairos is part of a thriving, open-source ecosystem with the resources and backing to stay sustainable for the long term.\\n\\n## Higher Standards and Best Practices\\n\\nWe\'ve been quiet about this milestone until now because the CNCF onboarding process is rigorous, and we wanted to make sure we did it right. This onboarding process wasn\u2019t just about paperwork\u2014it pushed us to adopt even higher levels of best practices. You can see some of the measures we\'ve adopted as part of this effort [here](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/9100). These improvements have been critical in refining Kairos, and we\'ve emerged from the onboarding process more secure, more reliable, and better aligned with industry standards.\\n\\n## Growing and Collaborating with the Cloud Native Community\\n\\nJoining the CNCF has opened many doors for us to connect with other projects and communities. This past year, we\'ve had the privilege of participating in KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Hong Kong as part of the Project Pavilion, where we had a booth to engage with users and fellow contributors. We\u2019ll be doing the same at KubeCon North America, and we\u2019d love to see you there!\\n\\nCome visit us on Wednesday, November 13, from 10:30 am to 3:15 pm at the Project Pavilion area of KubeCon North America. Through these events, we\'ve had the chance to collaborate with other CNCF project maintainers, share knowledge, and learn from one another. The spirit of open collaboration is at the heart of everything we do, and we\u2019ve gained valuable insights that are helping us make Kairos even better for you, our users.\\n\\n## Improved CI with ARM Support\\n\\nAnother benefit of being part of the CNCF is access to resources we didn\'t have before. Thanks to the CNCF, we now have ARM machines integrated into our CI pipelines, allowing us to test and build more efficiently. This not only speeds up our development process but also ensures Kairos runs smoothly on a wider range of hardware platforms, enhancing performance and broadening the scope of where you can use it.\\n\\n## A Community Effort\\n\\nFinally, we want to emphasize that none of this would have been possible without you\u2014our community. Your support, feedback, and contributions are what drive Kairos forward. Whether it\u2019s through submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or simply sharing your experiences, you have been an integral part of our journey. We are grateful to have such a passionate and engaged community that keeps us motivated and moving in the right direction.\\n\\nAs we continue to grow within the CNCF and the cloud-native space, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We remain committed to building Kairos in a way that benefits all of us, and we can\u2019t wait to share more with you in the future.\\n\\nSee you at KubeCon North America, and thank you for being with us every step of the way!"},{"id":"hacktoberfest-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/hacktoberfest-2024","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-10-07-hacktoberfest-2024.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-hacktoberfest-2024.md","title":"Hacktoberfest 2024","description":"Kairos\' Hacktoberfest","date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":1.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Morales","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mauromorales","x":"https://x.com/mauromrls"},"url":"https://github.com/mauromorales","imageURL":"https://github.com/mauromorales.png","key":"mauro-morales","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["mauro-morales"],"slug":"hacktoberfest-2024","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Hacktoberfest 2024"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Kairos Joins the CNCF as a Sandbox Project","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/cncf-sandbox-project"},"nextItem":{"title":"Enhancing Kairos Documentation with a Customizable Flavor Menu","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/flavor-menu"}},"content":"![Kairos\' Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79ca5ed-97fe-4eaf-b31c-1fd01ff457f0)\\n\\nI can\'t believe it\'s already October.

Our primary objective is to empower users to continue working with their preferred Linux distribution seamlessly. However, our previous documentation fell short of this goal. The scripts were tied to a default image, which often led to issues for users who preferred a different flavor.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\\nDuring our [first Hackweek](/docs/hackweek-2024), we took a significant step forward by updating our documentation to allow users to select their preferred flavor, thereby enhancing the overall experience.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nTo select your preferred flavor, simply use the drop-down menu at the top of the navigation bar on our website. Your selection is saved locally, meaning that if you access the documentation from a different browser or device, you\u2019ll need to reselect your flavor.\\n\\nSelecting your preferred flavor will automatically update the scripts displayed on the page. If an example is specific to a certain flavor, such as the installation on [Nvidia AGX Orin](/docs/nvidia_agx_orin), you will see a warning at the top of the page, and the scripts will not switch to your selected flavor.

We had our first hackweek! With everyone in the team connecting from their own corners of the world, Belgium, Greece, Italy and Spain, we came together not in person, but through a shared passion for hacking. Unlike typical team-building events, this hackweek was all about individual exploration \u2014 each team member diving into their own projects, driven by personal curiosity and the opportunity to experiment.\\n\\nOver the course of the week, we set aside our usual tasks to focus entirely on these self-driven projects, tackling challenges we rarely have time to address or exploring new avenues. In this post, I\u2019ll share a glimpse of some of the projects we worked on.\\n\\nDuring the first day we got together to brainstorm. Many good ideas came from each of us on what to work on. It lifts my spirit to see that our project while very stable, still has lots of avenues to explore and that everyone in our team is keen on making Kairos a better project.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Kairos Kiosk & Quiz App by Dimitris\\n\\nSince we have some upcoming events where we will have a booth, we were thinking of a way to break the ice, start conversations with people and keep them engaged.\\n\\nOne idea was to set up a Kairos Kiosk with an app that quizzes people passing by with questions that introduce them to the ideas behind Kairos. Those who answer correctly will receive a prize. This approach makes it feel like a game while also serving as a conversation starter, depending on the quiz questions.\\n\\nWe had a look and couldn\'t find an open source tool that would allow us to build such a quiz. Since I have been out of web development for quite some time, I thought it would be a refreshing project. I took the fastest road to success, using tools I was already familiar with, like [gin-gonic](https://gin-gonic.com/), [gorm](https://gorm.io/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).\\n\\nFor the front end I used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) because I\'m hearing that\'s what the cool kids use these days. Since I\'m terribly rusty in CSS, I had ChatGPT helping me out (actually doing most of the work at the front end).\\n\\nThe result of this effort is this repository: https://github.com/jimmykarily/quizmaker\\n\\nFuture plans include:\\n\\n- improve the README\\n- make it configurable so other teams can use their own logo and text\\n- create an easy way to collect results\\n- create an easy deployment method (kustomization / helm chart / other)\\n\\n![image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/433958/357165119-cbad99c7-71b6-4454-9d41-f44f12d2aaf9.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MjM0ODg1MTMsIm5iZiI6MTcyMzQ4ODIxMywicGF0aCI6Ii80MzM5NTgvMzU3MTY1MTE5LWNiYWQ5OWM3LTcxYjYtNDQ1NC05ZDQxLWY0NGYxMmQyYWFmOS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwODEyJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDgxMlQxODQzMzNaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT02ZDM2NTg2YzZmNzMzMzE5YjJhZmE4ZDUyM2UzYWNjZmRjZDQ4NTA4NzhlNGE1NzQ5MmY1OGJkOTI5M2FmY2U0JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.lya3AQtAb1usRx63HsTTyDQrf29MUkmiKRm4Mu6kuKw)\\n\\nI\'m hoping to have it in good shape to be used in one of our upcoming events. Stay tuned!\\n\\n## Raspberry Pi 5 & Docs Flavor Picker by Mauro\\n\\nAs for me, I first decided to try to install Kairos on a Raspberry Pi 5. I wasn\'t sure where to start since I\'m not an expert on how ARM boards boot a system. So I opened a new session with ChatGPT and went on a mission to understand how such systems boot. While I cannot call this experiment a success, since my Raspberry is not properly booting, I did learn a lot and feel much more confident to tackle some booting issue with these boards in the future. I decided not to pursue this further because the Kernel is not ready for it, but I put my learnings on a blog post.\\n\\nI decided to use the rest of the week to do some major change on our docs by introducing a Flavor Picker, where you can choose which Kairos Flavor (e.g. Ubuntu, openSUSE, etc) you prefer to read the docs and all scripts will show the selected flavor so that you don\'t have to be changing them manually but just copy and paste. A blog post about this change is also in the works.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile we each worked independently, the results of our individual efforts have already begun to ripple through the Kairos project, influencing our roadmap and inspiring new directions for future development. This hackweek wasn\u2019t about team building \u2014 it was about giving each person the space to innovate on their own terms, and the results speak for themselves.\\n\\nThe projects we embarked on, whether big or small, demonstrated the power of focused, independent exploration. We\u2019re excited to see how these initial ideas will evolve as we continue to develop and refine them in the coming months. This hackweek has shown us that sometimes, the best way to move forward is to give everyone the freedom to explore their own path, and we\u2019re eager to see where those paths will lead Kairos next."},{"id":"plausible-analytics","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/plausible-analytics","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-08-01-plausible-analytics.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-01-plausible-analytics.md","title":"Adding Analytics to Kairos.io","description":"Using a privacy focused analytics service on kairos.io","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":0.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Morales","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mauromorales","x":"https://x.com/mauromrls"},"url":"https://github.com/mauromorales","imageURL":"https://github.com/mauromorales.png","key":"mauro-morales","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["mauro-morales"],"description":"Using a privacy focused analytics service on kairos.io","slug":"plausible-analytics","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Adding Analytics to Kairos.io"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Our First Hackweek","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/hackweek-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Importance of Resilient Infrastructure: How Kairos Could Have Mitigated the CrowdStrike Outage","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/crowdstrike-outage"}},"content":"We recently added analytics to our website.

If affected organizations had adopted an immutable OS like Kairos, their systems would have shown greater resilience against such widespread disruptions.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\nCrowdStrike\'s faulty update led to massive system crashes. Kairos\'s immutable and decentralized architecture offers a robust alternative, ensuring system integrity and swift recovery in such scenarios.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## CrowdStrike Update: What Went Wrong\\n\\nOn July 19, 2024, a flawed update from CrowdStrike led to a significant number of Windows machines experiencing BSODs (Blue Screen of Death). This impacted operations across airlines, banks, broadcasters, and more. The issue arose from a misconfiguration in a file responsible for screening named pipes, leading to system crashes with a specific stop code. The resolution involved manual intervention on each affected device (imagine addressing this on a big flee of edge devices!), highlighting the vulnerability of traditional IT infrastructures to such disruptions.\\n\\n## How Kairos Ensures Resilience\\n\\nKairos, offers a fundamentally more resilient approach:\\n\\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Helps ensure that system states are consistent and unchangeable, significantly reducing the risk of configuration drift and unauthorized changes that could introduce vulnerabilities.\\n\\n- **Decentralized Deployment**: Allows each node to operate independently. This decentralization means that an issue affecting one node does not necessarily propagate across the entire network.\\n\\n- **Rapid Recovery**: Kairos\u2019s architecture allows for quick rollback to previous stable states, minimizing downtime. In the case of the CrowdStrike incident, affected systems could have been swiftly reverted to their last known good state.\\n\\n- **Enhanced Security**: By leveraging a secure boot process and a read-only root filesystem, Kairos minimizes attack vectors. Any attempt to alter system files or configurations would be futile, thereby protecting the system\'s integrity. Since the update came from CrodStrike, this would not have played a role in this specific incident, but it is still worth mentioning.\\n\\n## Reflecting on the xz Utils Backdoor Incident\\n\\nTo draw a parallel, let\u2019s recall the xz Utils backdoor incident. Kairos handled it with efficiency, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. When a backdoor was found in xz Utils, affecting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, Kairos\'s response was swift and effective. We identified that only Kairos Tumbleweed versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 were affected, removed the compromised artifacts, and provided clear guidance for remediation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe CrowdStrike incident underscores the necessity for resilient, immutable infrastructure in today\u2019s digital landscape. Kairos offers a proven solution, designed to withstand such disruptions and ensure continuity of operations. By adopting Kairos, organizations can protect themselves from similar future incidents, ensuring their systems remain secure, stable, and operational.\\n\\nFor a detailed understanding of our approach and how we handled the xz Utils backdoor, refer to our detailed [post on the incident](/blog/2024/04/02/xz-utils-backdoor/).\\n\\nStay resilient, stay secure."},{"id":"release-v3.1.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v3.1.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-07-19-release-v3.1.1.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-19-release-v3.1.1.md","title":"Kairos release v3.1.1","description":"Kairos release v3.1.1","date":"2024-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":1.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Itxaka Serrano","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/itxaka"},"url":"https://github.com/itxaka","imageURL":"https://github.com/itxaka.png","key":"itxaka-serrano","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["itxaka-serrano"],"description":"Kairos release v3.1.1","slug":"release-v3.1.1","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Kairos release v3.1.1"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Importance of Resilient Infrastructure: How Kairos Could Have Mitigated the CrowdStrike Outage","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/crowdstrike-outage"},"nextItem":{"title":"Kairos release v3.1","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v3.1"}},"content":"<h1 align=\\"center\\">\\n  <br />\\n     <img width=\\"184\\" alt=\\"kairos-white-column 5bc2fe34\\" src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/215073247-96988fd1-7fcf-4877-a28d-7c5802db43ab.png\\" />\\n    <br />\\n<br />\\n</h1>\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce the release of Kairos v3.1.1!

As threats become more sophisticated, understanding and implementing advanced boot security mechanisms like Trusted Boot, Full Disk Encryption (FDE), Secure Boot, and Measured Boot are critical for safeguarding data and ensuring system integrity. This article demystifies these concepts, explores their significance, and examines their implementation in modern computing environments, particularly focusing on the Linux ecosystem and the approaches within the Kairos project.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n> We are facing new challenges as 2024 starts. While AI is pushing innovating technologies to the edge, security becomes even more critical for organizations to protect sensitive data.\\n\\n![atm](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/868bad37-b00d-4db9-9904-ad16814f9f65)\\n> Image credits https://www.reddit.com/r/PBSOD/comments/c8nusw/it_is_now_safe_to_turn_off_your_computer_atm_in/\\n\\nAs industries evolve over time, security measures are increasing to protect edge devices from attackers. New attack vectors and vulnerabilities are exploited every day by cybercriminals, making it crucial for industries to continuously update and enhance their security systems. In the context of edge devices, which are computing elements that process data at the edge of the network, closer to the source of data generation, this need is even more pronounced. These devices, including ATMs, point-of-sale systems, and IoT devices, are often the front line of cybersecurity battles.\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges in securing edge devices is their inherent diversity and distributed nature. Unlike centralized systems, edge devices are spread across various locations, often in unsecured or semi-secured environments, making physical and network security a significant concern. This dispersion also implies a broad attack surface, with each device potentially offering a unique set of vulnerabilities. What we are trying to build here is a new foundation to define how to deploy secure devices which cannot be tampered with, and can keep data secure from malicious actors. We do want to protect the software stack that we run on it . \\n\\nOur goal is simple but complex to achieve: No unauthorized access to the software, to the data which is generated by the machine, and finally, we don\u2019t want the machine to execute modified code.\\n\\n\\n## The Essence of Boot Security and Encryption\\n\\n![DALL\xb7E](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/ea0a4d89-b037-44a2-a89b-7ad586787201)\\n\\n\\nHere comes Trusted Boot and SENA to the rescue. Easier to explain with an Alice metaphor.\\n\\n> You can read more about Trusted Boot in the [Lennart blog](https://0pointer.de/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.html) and about SENA in our [blog post](https://kairos.io/blog/2023/04/18/kairos-is-now-part-of-the-secure-edge-native-architecture-by-spectro-cloud-and-intel/)\\n\\nLet\'s imagine Alice has this super cool treasure chest, chock-full of her most prized stuff. She\u2019s big on security, but in a high-tech way \u2013 kind of like how your computer needs to keep its data safe. To get this done, your computer uses some smart tricks, things like Trusted Boot, Full Disk Encryption (FDE), Secure Boot, and Measured Boot.\\n\\nTo picture Full Disk Encryption, or FDE, think of it as Alice\u2019s treasure chest having a lock that only opens with a secret code. It\u2019s so clever that if someone breaks into her house and finds the chest, they still can\u2019t get inside without that special code. FDE is like that for your computer \u2013 it scrambles all your data so that only someone with the right password can read it.\\n\\nNext, there\'s Secure Boot. Imagine if Alice had this smart doorbell. When someone presses it, the doorbell checks if they\'re on the guest list. If they\'re not, no entry. Secure Boot is your computer\'s version of this smart doorbell. It checks every piece of software when your computer starts up and only lets the good, trusted stuff in. It keeps out anything that looks fishy.\\n\\nAnd then, we have Measured Boot. Picture this as Alice keeping a super detailed logbook. She writes down everything that goes on in her house \u2013 who comes in, what they do, you name it. If anything odd pops up, she\u2019s on it. Measured Boot does something similar for your computer. It watches over the startup process, takes notes, and makes sure everything\'s running just like it should, no funny business.\\n\\nPutting all these together, you\u2019ve got Trusted Boot, which is like Alice\'s ultimate home security system \u2013 the secret-code lock, the smart doorbell, and the detailed logbook, all working together. We\u2019re going to unpack how these nifty tools keep your computer as secure as Alice\u2019s treasure chest, making sure your digital world is safe every time you power up.\\n\\n\\n## Challenges and Solutions in Implementing FDE on Linux\\n\\n![DALL\xb7E](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/aee89c19-a5d1-4b75-8b05-bbeef4e2b47e)\\n\\n\\nWhile FDE is a standard feature in various operating systems, its implementation in Linux presents unique challenges. The initial boot stage, including the kernel and initial file system setup, cannot be fully encrypted as they have to be read by the firmware and the kernel respectively, leaving a portion of the system exposed. The initramfs for instance is responsible for unencrypting the portions of the disk. However, through careful measures, this unencrypted segment can be protected against tampering, thus securing the system\'s boot process and the encrypted data it accesses.\\n\\nThe Kairos project adopts \\"Unified Kernel Images\\" (UKI) to enhance boot security as defined by the [UAPI group](https://uapi-group.org/). UKI files are single, fat binaries that contain the OS and necessary boot components in a single, verified file. This approach simplifies the boot process, allowing for the entire system to be booted securely and efficiently, but it presents as well interesting challenges due to the Firmware restrictions that might depend on the hardware used(such as booting EFI large files, or handling Secure Boot certificates). By leveraging EFI files that can be signed and verified through Secure Boot and measured as a single entity, UKI files represent a significant advancement in boot security.\\n\\nCentral to the Trusted Boot mechanism is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a dedicated hardware (also emulated by firmware) component designed for secure cryptographic operations. TPM chips play a critical role in storing encryption keys and measurements securely, enabling the system to verify boot integrity and encrypt user data effectively.\\n\\n\\n## From Grub to systemd-boot\\n\\n![DALL\xb7E 2024-01-18 18 22 47 - Create a vintage-style digital artwork that visualizes the concept of modernizing technology infrastructure  The central focus should be a retro-futur](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/df3bce6f-4e88-4edd-83b2-ba2d333d9e6f)\\n\\nTrusted Boot is deeply integrated into systemd and is currently being actively developed. Linux offers a variety of init systems and bootloaders, such as GRUB. However, systemd includes tools like systemd-measure and ukify, which, although they work with various bootloaders, are particularly effective with systemd-boot. What sets systemd-boot apart from GRUB and other bootloaders is its focus on hardware compatibility support. As we aim to support modern hardware that must meet specific requirements, we prioritize minimizing the attack surface. Therefore, a narrower scope of support is a better fit for our specific needs and preferred over bootloaders designed for broad hardware compatibility, which often carry legacy code and a large patchset (for instance, you can see the number of patches that SUSE applies on top of standard [GRUB](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Base:System/grub2) package to add support to specific hardware/improve the functionalities). This presents a strong argument for choosing systemd, especially systemd-boot, over other bootloaders which targets recent hardware and a smaller scope.\\n\\nWhy this makes sense: We\'re now in an era where outdated hardware is not our concern. Modern devices don\'t require old drivers, so we have the opportunity to streamline our systems. This translates to a principle of \'less is more\' in our code and in our stack - less software in our stack means enhanced security. We aim for a leaner runtime to run our software, minimizing potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, it also makes sense to use tools that adhere closely to standard specifications.\\n\\nConsidering the transition to modern hardware, especially with widespread EFI support, systemd-stub or systemd-boot is a strong contender to replace GRUB. GRUB has been a staple in the Linux community for years, evolving from versions 0.x to 2.x, which if you are seasoned like me, you have witnessed almost all of them! However, it\'s worth considering the extensive patches applied by distributions and its expansive codebase. While its extensive support and scripting capabilities were once advantageous, they now detract from its suitability as a lightweight option.\\n\\nThe goal is clear: we aim to minimize complexity in building a secure, efficient stack, reusing as much components well trusted and established by the community. By reducing the number of components, we strive for a more secure and streamlined system.\\n\\n## Booting in Linux\\n\\nWhen a Linux system starts, it goes through a multi-stage process to load the operating system. This process can be broken down roughly into the following steps:\\n\\n1. Firmware Initialization: The system\'s firmware, which could be BIOS or UEFI, performs initial hardware checks and configurations. It then searches for a bootloader, which is typically located in the boot partition or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the storage device.\\n1. Bootloader Execution: The bootloader, such as GRUB, is a software responsible for loading the main part of the operating system. Its primary task is to find the Linux kernel, usually located in the same partition, and load it into memory. The bootloader might present a menu or configuration options to choose different kernels or operating systems if multiple are installed.\\n1. Kernel Loading and Initialization: The kernel is the core of the Linux operating system. Once loaded, it initializes the system\'s hardware and sets up essential services. During this phase, the kernel decompresses and loads an initrd (initial ramdisk). The initrd is a temporary root file system loaded into memory. It includes essential tools and scripts needed to mount the real root file system. In modern Linux systems, initrd is often replaced by initramfs, which serves a similar purpose.\\n1. File System Setup and Transition: Inside initrd, scripts are executed to prepare the actual root file system. This includes tasks like decrypting and encrypted partitions if present. After preparations are complete, the system makes a transition, referred to as \\"pivoting\\", to the actual root file system.\\n1. Root File System and User Data: The root partition, now mounted as the root file system, contains all the user data, system configurations, binaries, drivers, and other necessary components for the operating system to function. This is where the system runs from once the boot process is complete.\\n\\nThroughout these stages, the components\u2014firmware, bootloader, kernel, initrd, and the root file system\u2014work in a sequence to load the operating system successfully. \\n\\nThis chain is the one we in the Linux and tech industry are very much familiar with. Several designs and strategies have been developed to secure this stack over time, for instance Verified kernels and drivers, or Secure Boot to sign the bootloader and be able to trust its authenticity. There are various bootloader implementations as well, tied to more secure HW (like TPM devices).\\n\\nHowever, as technologies and security measures evolved, attacks evolved as well. Specific hardware now can be leveraged to increase the security posture of the boot process, and it is time for a change, as the market demands more sophisticated security measures to protect against malicious actors.\\n\\n## Booting with a TPM-equipped Hardware\\n\\nWhen a device equipped with TPM, and a sufficiently modern hardware boots, several steps happen sequentially.\\n\\nMany hardware platforms use a Core Root of Trust for Measurements (CRTM), which is the very first thing that boots, even before the firmware. The CRTM gets a hash of the firmware and sends it to the TPM chip, which measures the running software and is a requirement for trusted boot. The TPM chip then loads the firmware/BIOS. \\n\\nThe TPM takes note of the measurement and stores the hash in a bank of multiple platform configuration registers (PCRs). In order to store measurements, the TPM chip extends the banks from the previous values, as these changes to the stack are easy to recognize during the boot.\\n\\n![CRTM trusted boot](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/5a0244c3-ff58-4ea0-83b3-b391ccac0b91)\\n\\nNext, the BIOS or firmware measures the subsequent stage (bootloader or UKI) and sends it to the TPM, then loads the UKI and continues booting.\\n\\nOnce the TPM is asked to release an encryption key to unseal the full disk encryption, it will check if the measurements it has are valid. If a bootloader is present, it will have already measured the UKI files, and measurement also happens when initrd starts and when the running system is ready to check any manipulations (e.g., kernel boot command line). The process is also bound to the secure boot signatures, so any manipulation of the UKI files would be allowed only by the key holders.\\n\\nIf a malicious attacker tries to load custom software or modify an image in any way, they must extend the PCR value and align it with the value it would have had following an expected boot. The cryptographic robustness of the hash algorithm makes achieving this computationally expensive, thereby helping to support security. \\n\\nIf the firmware or bootloader have been tampered with, the hash values stored in the PCR won\u2019t match expected measurements, and the system will flag an alert and prevent boot from happening \u2014 intentionally bricking the host device as a failsafe (the host is still recoverable by re-installing everything from scratch). \\n\\n## Kairos and Trusted Boot\\n\\n![standardlinux](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/df635d48-e9ff-4759-98d0-3cdaa87ee8b5)\\n\\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind EFI files and the boot process, let\'s delve into the way typical Linux distributions manage booting with Full Disk Encryption (FDE):\\n\\n- Initially, the firmware retrieves the bootloader from the boot partition (or Master Boot Record - MBR) and transitions control to a kernel.\\n- This kernel then unpacks an initrd, which houses essential tools needed for initializing the file system (FS) and transitioning to the operational system environment.\\n\\nIn this setup, each component is distinct: the Kernel and Initrd are separate files, whereas the root partition is a unified file system encompassing all user data (such as installed binaries, password files, sensitive information, drivers, etc.). The primary function of the initrd in this scenario is to decrypt partitions and set up mount points as it transitions control to a different partition.\\n\\n![kairosboot](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/b8e5d6ab-f160-43f2-adb8-395f445dbc12)\\n\\n\\nContrastingly, the Kairos architecture utilizes a singular image file that amalgamates the rootfs, kernel, and initrd. Here, the initrd is responsible for establishing the FS and activating the rootfs.\\n\\nThe bootloader plays a pivotal role in this architecture by accessing image files stored within the state partition. \\n\\nWhile the state partition remains unencrypted, the system\'s operational projection is derived from the encrypted user-data partition. Directories such as `/etc` and `/opt` (which can be fully customized) are overlaid, safeguarding sensitive information from being exposed within the state partition. Nevertheless, this design, along with the previously mentioned setup, is vulnerable to \\"Evil Maid Attacks.\\" These attacks involve altering the system by booting from a LiveCD and modifying the booted images.\\n\\n\\n![boot_1](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/19b61dd1-b33f-4cfe-9d0a-b60198b0cfd5)\\n\\nIn the context of the UKI (Unified Kernel Image) architecture, which closely resembles the Kairos model, the primary distinction lies in the storage of a singular EFI image file within the boot partition. This arrangement facilitates the signing and verification of EFI files to ensure they haven\'t been tampered with, leveraging SecureBoot in tandem with Measured Boot. These mechanisms verify that the image is certified by a trusted authority and remains unmodified.\\n\\nDuring the boot process, cryptographic assessments are made using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to confirm the system\'s integrity. Drive decryption during boot is contingent upon consistent signing by the same authority and accurate boot measurement matching. System upgrades involve updating the boot measurement to enable access to the user data partitions.\\n\\n![bootingkeys](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos-docs/assets/2420543/49ad3793-b53e-40e9-96da-58cec5d4df4c)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Security consideration\\n\\nThe existing framework guarantees that the initial phase (UKI file) remains immutable, with only this phase capable of decrypting the drive\'s encrypted data. Indeed there is no pivoting into another system like in the traditional Linux boot process. This design choice ensures that the system remains a single component, with the UKI file acting as the sole point of entry for the system.\\n\\nShifting to a different image would have introduced potential security vulnerabilities and constraints:\\n\\n- The current Systemd tools lack the capability to assess another rootfs/file.\\n- There is an absence of mechanisms to incorporate PCR with hash checksums of bespoke files in the expanded PCR banks within systemd.\\n- The inability to evaluate a secondary phase means any alterations in this stage could remain undetected during operation.\\n\\nAlso, implementing measurements for a second phase would significantly complicate the update process, as each version (A/B, Recovery) would require corresponding updates and measurements for every file involved in the transition.\\n\\nAn alternative approach involves maintaining a singular initial phase, which would entail measuring all subsequent stages. However, this concept remains a topic of ongoing debate without any concrete solutions thus far.\\n\\nA concrete example: should a hacker remotely access the system without measures in place for the transitioned stage, they could alter the entire rootfs during operation without detection. In contrast, by leaving the first stage unaltered in the current method, modifications to the rootfs are prevented.\\n\\n## Learn More\\nTrusted boot is one of many recommended security techniques \u2014 but it\u2019s absolutely critical to ensuring you can trust the integrity of your device, particularly when it\u2019s deployed in the field.\\n\\nWe\'ve only just scratched the surface of trusted boot as a concept, how it works and the architectural details of the Kairos implementation that contribute to the overall security posture.

Someone managed to put a backdoor on xz Utils, a very common package on Linux systems. In this post I want to share with you about what happened, how it impacted Kairos images, and what you should do in case you were affected.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\nA backdoor that can be used to exploit systemd based Linux via ssh was introduced in xz Utils. Only Kairos Tumbleweed v3.0.1 and v3.0.2 were affected. We deleted all related OCI images from our repos and artifacts from our releases. If you installed it and the system was exposed to the internet, you should do a complete re-install. If you hosted security keys in given system, you should rotate them.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## xz Utils Backdoor\\n\\nVersions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz Utils, which is used in many Linux distributions, are infected with a backdoor mechanism. Even if you don\'t install xz Utils directly, you might still be exposed if you\'re on a systemd based distribution, which is the case of most commonly used distros nowadays. This is because the init system, has a dependency on liblzma one of the affected libraries. The attack can be triggered via ssh access, which could have been catastrophic considering how many systems today connect to the internet.\\n\\nIf you want to read more about how the backdoor read [one](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/) of [these](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/) posts, or read [Andres\' disclosure email to the OSS](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4). However, more interesting than the technical implementation of the backdoor, is all the social engineering that took place.\\n\\nI would like to bring your attention to the fact that in 2024, many critical open-source projects are still maintained by individuals, who do this on their spare time and who are not paid for it. It\'s no wonder that these maintainers are burned out or suffering of other mental health issues, as it is the case of the official xz Utils maintainer. Under such conditions it\'s no wonder that he was tricked by a malicious actor. As a community, we must find a solution because this time the issue was caught before it widespread, but we might not be as lucky next time.\\n\\n## How it affected us?\\n\\nOn Monday, April 1st, after reading about the news, team member Dimitris Karakasilis decided to investigate which of our systems was affected. In his evaluation he noticed that the infected xz packages reached only Kairos Tumbleweed v3.0.1 and v3.0.2. The affected package never reached any of our other flavors since they are not rolling releases and therefore didn\'t get a package update.\\n\\nAfter the analysis, on April 2nd, we deleted all related artifacts including OCI images from quay.io/kairos/opensuse, and ISOs from out [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases). Despite the artifacts not being available any longer, we decided to add a note of caution on the affected releases for anyone who wonders why the Tumbleweed artifacts are missing, and to better inform users on how react.\\n\\n## What to do if you were affected?\\n\\nSince only Tumblweed was affected, we decided to point you directly to [openSUSE\'s recommendation](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/29/xz-backdoor/), in which they recommend to:\\n\\n> For our openSUSE Tumbleweed users where SSH is exposed to the internet, we recommend installing fresh, as it\u2019s unknown if the backdoor has been exploited.\\n> \\n> Due to the sophisticated nature of the backdoor an on-system detection of a breach is likely not possible.\\n> \\n> Also rotation of any credentials that could have been fetched from the system is highly recommended.\\n\\nhttps://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3094.html"},{"id":"spos-panel-at-kubecon-paris-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/spos-panel-at-kubecon-paris-2024","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-03-26-spos-panel-at-kubecon-paris-2024.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-26-spos-panel-at-kubecon-paris-2024.md","title":"SPOS Panel at KubeCon Paris 2024","description":"I recently had the opportunity to attend KubeCon 2024.

You can find my recap at the [Spectro Cloud Blog](https://www.spectrocloud.com/blog/kubecon-paris-edge-ai-and-la-vie-en-cloud-native), but I\'d like to add some additional information about the Special Purpose Operating System Panel in which we participated.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nThe panel was scheduled for the last day of KubeCon, which I think probably hurt the attendance since many people had already left. Nevertheless, according to the scheduling tool, 351 people were planning to attend.\\n\\nOn set, we had Sean McGinnis from AWS representing Bottlerocket, Danielle Tal from Microsoft representing Flatcar, Felipe Huici from Unikraft representing Unikraft, Justin Haynes from Google representing COS and myself from Spectro Cloud representing Kairos. The panel was moderated by Thilo Fromm also from Microsoft, who did a fantastic job keeping everyone engaged. In the audience we also had representatives from Talos and EveOS. Most of us are part of the Special Purpose Operating System Work Group under the CNCF TAG Runtime.\\n\\nWe started with a short introduction about what SPOSes are, and it was refreshing to hear that the audience had a good idea. If you head to the [CNCF Work Group page](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/spos/charter/), you will see that we use the following definition:\\n\\n> Special Purpose Operating Systems are designed to run well defined workloads with minimal boilerplate of dependencies suited for niche use cases.\\n\\nIn the case of Kairos, our specialization focuses on Day-2 operations on Edge devices, but not excluding other setups including Kubernetes. This means that in our OS we try to pack everything users will need to keep their devices secure, remotely manageable and as lean as possible.\\n\\nNext, we presented a slide called Landscape which had one axis going from Highly Specialized to Flexible/Customizable. In my opinion this is misleading because as I previously mentioned Kairos is highly specialized, however it is also very flexible and customizable. My best example for this is that we are the only SPOS which can be based on different Linux distributions. If you are looking for such a specialized solution but come from Alpine, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu or Rocky Linux, you don\'t have to give up your existing OS know-how because there\'s a Kairos version for you.\\n\\nThe landscape analogy still fits, but instead of having to fit the different SPOSes into made up groups, I think of it as consisting of areas like Kubernetes, Edge Computing, AI, Data Centers, etc. and each of the different SPOSes being specialized in one or more of these areas. On a completely different axis, we could define the flexibility and customization for each individual SPOS. For example, Talos, has an opinionated API to handle the OS, so we could consider it more rigid, while all other projects that give ssh access would be on the other end of the spectrum. And this can be applied to different topics, like configuration management, Kubernetes distribution, etc. That rigidity or flexibility is not necessarily good or bad but better depending on what you are trying to achieve.\\n\\nThe rest of the time was dedicated for Q&A.\\n\\nLast but not least, let me reiterate like I did in the Spectro Cloud post that, these panels and similar initiatives are important because they help users understand why these projects exist and get an idea of why we have different options and how that makes us a stronger community instead of rivals.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD-T9LdfvrM\\" title=\\"Special Purpose Operating Systems: The Next Step in OS Evolution or One-Trick Ponies?\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"release-v3","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v3","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2024-03-08-release-v3.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-08-release-v3.md","title":"Kairos release v3","description":"Kairos release v3","date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":3.1,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Morales","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mauromorales","x":"https://x.com/mauromrls"},"url":"https://github.com/mauromorales","imageURL":"https://github.com/mauromorales.png","key":"mauro-morales","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["mauro-morales"],"description":"Kairos release v3","slug":"release-v3","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Kairos release v3"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SPOS Panel at KubeCon Paris 2024","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/spos-panel-at-kubecon-paris-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Kairos at FOSDEM 2024","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/Kairos-at-FOSDEM-2024"}},"content":"<h1 align=\\"center\\">\\n  <br />\\n     <img width=\\"184\\" alt=\\"kairos-white-column 5bc2fe34\\" src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/215073247-96988fd1-7fcf-4877-a28d-7c5802db43ab.png\\" />\\n    <br />\\n<br />\\n</h1>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe team is very excited to announce the next major release of Kairos, Kairos v3! This release marks a major milestone in our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2/views/1) by adding support for Unified Kernel Images (UKI). This will enhance the level of security that you can achieve on your system with the help of Trusted Boot.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Trusted Boot\\n\\nAt a glance, this feature will enable users of Kairos, to measure and sign with your own keys the Kernel, initrd and boot cmdline, ensuring that only your images can be booted in a given system. An in-depth post will follow explaining the technicalities of how we do this. In the meantime, you can head to our docs:\\n\\n- [Trusted Boot Architecture](https://kairos.io/docs/architecture/trustedboot/)\\n- [Trusted Boot Installation](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/trustedboot/)\\n- [Trusted Boot Upgrades](https://kairos.io/docs/upgrade/trustedboot/)\\n\\n## Versioned Docs\\n\\nUntil now, we only had one source of documentation. We know this can be problematic because you weren\'t able to tell from the documentation if a certain feature, configuration or else was meant for the nightly release or if it was already included in the Kairos version you\'re running. We did our best adding \\"notes\\" on some of the sections, but as you can image this becomes problematic easily. For this reason, we\'ve decided to version our documentation page starting with v3. To access it, all you need to do is head to https://kairos.io/docs/ and click on the Releases\' menu in the nav bar, which will list the available versions, including \\"master\\" which is our nighly release. Please check it out and let us know what you think.\\n\\n## Known Issues\\n\\n* \ud83d\udc1b Raspberry: EFI booting no longer supported on kernels shipped with ubuntu > 22.04 [#2249](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2249)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b Filesystem expansion on rpi4 doesn\'t work with Alpine [#1995](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/1995)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b cgroup_memory not mounted in Alpine rpi4 [#2002](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2002)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b Upgrade on Alpine arm errors [#2135](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2135)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b reset from the GRUB menu on Alpine amd64, gets stuck in an endless loop [#2136](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2136)\\n\\n## Deprecation Warnings\\n\\nReading of `/etc/elemental/config.yaml` was broken for a bit but should be fixed in v3, but it will be eventually deprecated in one of the upcoming releases. If you\'re making use of it, please move this configuration to `/etc/kairos/config.yaml`\\n\\n\\n## Flavor Updates\\n\\n* UKI Ubuntu and non-UKI Ubuntu differ a bit. This is because there is a limitation on the image size that can be loaded. This is defined by the firmware, so we cannot guarantee a common image size that will work on every system. So far we have seen limits of around 800Mb to 1Gb. We will continue working towards this goal so Kairos UKI images can be booted in as many systems as possible.\\n* It is now possible to build Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, but we don\'t release any artifacts yet, and will only do so when it\'s officially released.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor a comprehensive view of all the changes in this release, please refer to [the full changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (And be sure to check out the \\"Known issues\\" section for any potential hiccups.)\\n\\nThis release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our project, and we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

You can check out the slides and recordings [here](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2983-from-free-lunch-to-dog-fooding-a-culinary-journey-in-crafting-iac-for-kairos-testing-and-building/) (as soon as they become available). We were quite pleased with the level of attendance, and we believe that the message came across.\\n\\nIf you attended the talk, and tried to reach out in person, we\'re sorry that we didn\'t give you a chance, we needed to make space for the next speaker. Please don\'t hesitate to use any of our communication channels in the [community page](/community/).\\n\\n## Special Purpose Operating Systems Panel (SPOS)\\n\\nOriginally, representatives from Kairos, [Flatcar](https://www.flatcar.org/), and [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org/) wanted to have a panel between the different SPOSs. Unfortunately, FOSDEM didn\'t accept our request until the day of the event, so everything had to be done ad-hoc. Which probably ended up being a good thing because we were lucky to also have the participation from [Eve-OS](https://lfedge.org/projects/eve/), [MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/) and [Softiron](https://softiron.com/) on top of the gang which originally signed up.\\n\\nI personally found it very helpful to hear we were not alone in our struggles and to learn about how each OS tries to solve sometimes the same problem a little differently depending on their target audience and vision.\\n\\nWe agreed to meet again for FOSDEM 25, so if you\'re working in a single-purpose OS, it would be great to get to know you and your project next year. Please reach out via the [CNCF SPOS working group charter](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/spos/).\\n\\nAnother good news is that, the panel will still take place because the submission got accepted at KubeCon. Representatives from Bottlerocket (AWS), COS (Google), Flatcar (Microsoft), Kairos (Spectro Cloud), and Unikraft will meet on [Friday, March 22nd](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeSR) to talk about what makes our OSs different and what unites us.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you probably know, Kairos is fully open-sourced, for us this means that we will keep working towards reaching out to users and other projects as much as we can. We believe this is the best way to contribute to the community overall and to build a great project.\\n\\nIf you want to know about events we are interested in attending, you can find them on our [Outreach project](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/4).

This time, we focused on the ground work for two major features that will land later in the year\\n\\n1. **Improving the Kairos Factory user experience**: On previous releases we shared how our artifact names have changed to make it easier to distinguish between them. In this release we worked on Versioneer, a component that helps build such names in more sofisticated ways than the original script did. This has been aggregated to the `kairos-agent upgrade` command to help you filter through upgradable versions.\\n2. **Adding support for UKI (Unified Kernel Images)**: This is still a WIP but we already have a proof of concept, meaning that Kairos will increase its security level by validating signatures using the EFI bootloader.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Known Issues\\n\\nWe haven\'t been able to address the following issues on Alpine:\\n\\n* \ud83d\udc1b Filesystem expansion on rpi4 doesn\'t work with Alpine [#1995](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/1995)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b cgroup_memory not mounted in Alpine rpi4 [#2002](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2002)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b Upgrade on Alpine arm errors [#2135](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2135)\\n* \ud83d\udc1b reset from the GRUB menu on Alpine amd64, gets stuck in an endless loop [#2136](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2136)\\n\\n## Flavor Updates\\n\\n* Ubuntu 23.04 got updated to 23.10\\n* Alpine 3.18 got updated to 3.19\\n* We know produce Raspberry Pi 3 Artifacts thanks to the contribution to our community member [Ludea](https://github.com/Ludea) [#1966](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/pull/1966)\\n\\nFor a comprehensive view of all the changes in this release, please refer to [the full changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v2.5.0) (And be sure to check out the \\"Known issues\\" section for any potential hiccups.)\\n\\nThis release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our project, and we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

It has happened to everybody (if not, let me know).\\nThis Kairos release was a similar case. We didn\'t introduce any breaking changes and it was just bug fixes, which makes it a patch release.  At least that\'s the story for user facing changes. Because, behind the scenes, we made some heavy changes, in the way we produce the Kairos artifacts and how we name them.\\n\\nThe detailed list of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v2.4.2) but the most important things to notice are listed below.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## New artifact names\\n\\nThe artifacts (including container images) have consistent names which include all the information about the image. For example, the \\"standard\\" image (with k3s) for the Opensuse leap 15.5, targeting amd64 generic devices, in Kairos version 2.4.0, was called:\\n\\n```\\nquay.io/kairos/kairos-opensuse-leap:v2.4.0-k3sv1.27.3-k3s1\\n```\\n\\nIn version 2.4.2 it\'s called:\\n\\n```\\nquay.io/kairos/opensuse:leap-15.5-standard-amd64-generic-v2.4.2-k3sv1.27.6-k3s1\\n```\\n\\nFirst of all the beginning of the image name reads naturally like the distro is usually named, including the version of the upstream distribution (15.5). Then, there is the information about:\\n\\n- the variant (core or standard)\\n- the architecture (amd64, arm64 etc)\\n- the model (generic, rpi4 etc)\\n- the Kairos version (v2.4.2) including the k3s version if it\'s a standard image\\n\\nAnd the same information is there in the bootable artifact name in the same order:\\n\\n[kairos-opensuse-leap-15.5-standard-amd64-generic-v2.4.2-k3sv1.27.6+k3s1.iso](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/download/v2.4.2/kairos-opensuse-leap-15.5-standard-amd64-generic-v2.4.2-k3sv1.27.6+k3s1.iso)\\n\\n\\n## Less Earthly, more Dockerfiles\\n\\nMuch of the logic from [Earthly](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/blob/a658a3fa5f294b14377631dedfa0031d3551f2b2/Earthfile#L317) has been moved to [the Dockerfiles](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/master/imageshttps://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/master/images). And while this seems like an internal technical detail, it take us closer to a simpler build process, which everyone can replicate in their own CI to build custom Kairos images. The input to the dockerfiles is the information you see in the artifact names (see above) and comes directly from the [flavors.json file](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/blob/a658a3fa5f294b14377631dedfa0031d3551f2b2/.github/flavors.json#L1). If all this sounds complicated, just keep this:\\n\\nIn one of the next releases, is will be possible to build a full Kairos image (standard or core) using only one of the dockerfiles (no Earthly) and a block of information like:\\n\\n```\\n\\"flavor\\": \\"opensuse\\",\\n\\"flavorRelease\\": \\"leap-15.5\\",\\n\\"variant\\": \\"standard\\",\\n\\"model\\": \\"generic\\",\\n\\"baseImage\\": \\"opensuse/leap:15.5\\",\\n\\"arch\\": \\"amd64\\",\\n```\\n\\nThis allows one to change the base image above, to a derivative of `opensuse/leap:15.5` (e.g. on with some additional packages installed). It also justifies the next item, please read on.\\n\\n## Alma linux removal from artifacts\\n\\nWe identified that Rocky linux and Alma linux were completely similar in regards to building steps. Given the resource and time constraints we have, we decided to no longer build and release Alma linux artifacts.\\nThe dockerfile for the [rhel family](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/blob/a658a3fa5f294b14377631dedfa0031d3551f2b2/img/Dockerfile.rhel#L1) supports the `almalinux` flavor.\\nBuilding an Alma linux Kairos image from the [Kairos repository](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/) root, is as simple as:\\n\\n```\\nearthly --platform=linux/amd64 +base-image \\\\\\n    --VARIANT=core \\\\\\n    --FLAVOR=almalinux \\\\\\n    --FLAVOR_RELEASE=9.2 \\\\\\n    --BASE_IMAGE=almalinux:9.2 \\\\\\n    --MODEL=generic \\\\\\n    --FAMILY=rhel\\n```\\n\\n## Transition to pure Alpine\\n\\nIn our latest release of Kairos, we\'ve made a significant shift in the architecture of our Alpine flavor. We\'ve transitioned from using the initramfs and kernel from both openSUSE and Ubuntu to a full-fledged Alpine kernel and initramfs system. This change marks a significant milestone in our journey to provide a more robust and efficient system for our users.\\n\\n### The Old System\\n\\nPreviously, our Alpine flavor of Kairos was built on two different systems. One used the initramfs and kernel from openSUSE, and the other used the initramfs and kernel from Ubuntu. Both systems used the Alpine root file system. While these setups served us well, they had their limitations. The most notable one was the use of systemd during the initramfs and openrc during system boot. This dual system added complexity and potential points of failure to our boot process.\\n\\n### The New System\\n\\nIn our new release, we\'ve written our own implementation of the initramfs script for our Alpine flavor. This script sets up the system, creating a more streamlined and efficient boot process.\\n\\nThe switch to the Alpine kernel and initramfs system brings several benefits:\\n\\n1. **Simplicity**: Alpine Linux is designed to be simple, which makes it easier to maintain and less prone to errors.\\n2. **Security**: Alpine Linux uses musl libc and busybox to provide a small binary size with significant security benefits.\\n3. **Efficiency**: The Alpine kernel and initramfs system are lightweight, which means Kairos now requires fewer resources to run.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe transition to a full Alpine kernel and initramfs system is a significant step forward for our Alpine flavor of Kairos. It simplifies our architecture, improves security, and increases efficiency.\\nThe changes in the build process make Kairos more friendly to customizations. The naming changes, make it easier to navigate among the numerous artifacts we generate with every release. Finally the various bug fixes and smaller improvements should make it a more stable release for everyone.\\n\\nWe\'re excited about these changes and look forward to seeing how they benefit our users.\\n\\n\\nReach out to us with your comments!"},{"id":"hacktoberfest-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/hacktoberfest-2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2023-09-26-hacktoberfest-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-26-hacktoberfest-2023.md","title":"Hacktoberfest 2023","description":"Hacktoberfest 2023 is here, and we are excited to announce that Kairos is taking part by creating some good first issues","date":"2023-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":3.03,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Morales","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mauromorales","x":"https://x.com/mauromrls"},"url":"https://github.com/mauromorales","imageURL":"https://github.com/mauromorales.png","key":"mauro-morales","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["mauro-morales"],"slug":"hacktoberfest-2023","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Hacktoberfest 2023"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Kairos release v2.4.2","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v2.4.2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Kairos release v2.4","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v2.4"}},"content":"Hacktoberfest 2023 is here, and we are excited to announce that Kairos is taking part by creating some good first issues\\nfor new contributors to get started with and also by hosting a Hacktoberfest event on October 19th in Brussels.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why is Hacktoberfest important to us?\\n\\nWe believe in open source, this is why all of Kairos\' source code is fully open-sourced, but our commitment doesn\'t stop\\nthere, we also want to help developers, students and anyone interested to learn more about open source and how they can\\ncontribute to it.\\n\\n## Why is Kairos a good project to contribute to?\\n\\nKairos is one of those projects that touches many different areas of software development, from the frontend to the\\nbackend.

We\'ve worked hard to make them more consistent and easier to identify, streamlining your experience in finding the right elements for your project.\\n\\n## Raspberry Pi Enhancements\\n\\nFor those using Raspberry Pi devices, we\'ve addressed several issues, including serial console problems and auto expansion of the last partition, among others. This ensures a smoother experience when using our project on Raspberry Pi devices, making it more versatile and reliable than ever before. We\'ve also split the RPI images into rpi3 and rpi4 versions due to partitioning issues, with support for GPT being exclusive to rpi4.\\n\\n## Configuration Centralization\\n\\nWe\'ve taken a step toward simplifying your configuration process by consolidating all settings to the kairos-config (/etc/elemental/config.yaml is no longer used). This change streamlines your configuration management, making it more straightforward and efficient.\\n\\n## Merged Release Pipelines\\n\\nIn an effort to provide a more unified experience, we\'ve merged the kairos-io/kairos and kairos-io/provider-kairos release pipelines. Going forward, kairos-io/kairos will serve as the canonical location for all artifacts, both \\"standard\\" and \\"core,\\" making it easier than ever to access and manage your resources.\\n\\n## K3S Releases Alignment\\n\\nTo align more closely with upstream releases, we have limited the number of k3s releases bundled with our project to match the three most recent minor release versions. This ensures that you have access to the latest features and improvements while maintaining stability.\\n\\n## Streamlined Package Management\\n\\nKairos overlay files now come directly from luet packages, eliminating the need for them to be included in the repository. Similarly, K3S packages are now sourced directly from luet packages, providing better control over versions and ensuring a more consistent upgrade cadence.\\n\\n## Kairos Agent Updates (v2.2.11)\\n\\nOur Kairos agent has received significant updates in this release, bringing a host of improvements and new features:\\n\\n- Single Source for Configuration: We\'ve simplified configuration management by merging two different files into one, the cloud-config, for configuring install, upgrade, and reset behaviors. Check out the full reference in our documentation to migrate your existing configurations.\\n\\n- Create Dirs in Rootfs: For situations where you need to create directories in the rootfs, we\'ve introduced a new option in the configuration to facilitate this process, enhancing flexibility.\\n\\n- Upgrade Workflow from Passive: We\'ve improved the upgrade workflow when booting from the passive image, ensuring that only the active image is updated, preventing issues with a broken system.\\n\\n- Auto Partition and Image Size: Say goodbye to fixed partition and image sizes. The agent now dynamically calculates optimal sizes based on the source for installation, creating partitions accordingly.\\n\\n- Overridable Partition and Image Size: If you prefer to customize partition and image sizes, you can now do so directly via cloud config, allowing you to fine-tune the sizes for each action (install, upgrade, reset).\\n\\n- Improved Unattended Reset: Unattended reset now works seamlessly in any terminal or service, automatically rebooting when needed. It offers greater flexibility and reliability across various scenarios.\\n\\n- run-stage Command: We\'ve fixed several underlying issues related to cloud provider metadata, user creation, and partition layout, ensuring a smoother operation.\\n\\n - Upgrade Recovery: Recovery upgrades are now possible with the introduction of flags to facilitate the process. Normal upgrades also include a warning to remind users to upgrade recovery when necessary.\\n\\n\\nFor a comprehensive view of all the changes in this release, please refer to [the full changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v2.4.0) (And be sure to check out the \\"Known issues\\" section for any potential hiccups.)\\n\\nThis release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our project, and we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

This release is a major release as reflect changes to internal core components and enhanced support for the ARM architecture.\\n  \\n### What changed?\\n\\nThis release brings updates to the Kairos core components, including a substantial refactor of internal components and several bugfixes.\\n\\nIn order to enhance the user experience and reduce maintenance efforts the `elemental` cli and the `kairos-agent` functionalities were merged together. The `kairos-agent` now is responsible for the lifecycle of Kairos. This includes upgrades, setup, and delegating configuration to the specific providers that implement the specific configuration (k3s, for instance). The cloud-init stages can be run directly with the `kairos-agent`, and there is a `--debug` flag now to ease out troubleshooting. We also have renamed and moved user-facing commands of the Kairos CLI to `kairosctl`.\\n\\nBesides, the Kairos agent now is capable to support multi-arch images, as such is now possible to specify container images during upgrades for different platforms within the same tag.\\n\\nWe consolidated our support for the ARM architecture, most notably:\\n\\n- Generic iso ARM images, that can be used for development or in VMs\\n- Support for [Nvidia AGX Orin](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/nvidia_agx_orin/)!\\n- RPI images now are shipping with LVM, and as such the oem partition is available as in the `x86_64` flavors. Note: Reset is not working, we are addressing this into a patch release.\\n- Add ubuntu to the available RPI images\\n\\nWe are working also on a pure, Alpine flavor, which is now independent from systemd. Stay tuned!\\n\\nIf you are curious on what\'s next, check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2) and feel free to engage with our [community](https://kairos.io/community/)!\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor a full list of changes, see the  [Changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v2.2.0). We hope you find these updates useful and as always, let us know if you have any questions or feedback.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/files/11250843/Secure-Edge-Native-Architecture-white-paper-20240417.3.pdf)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## What is SENA?\\n\\nSENA stands for \\"Secure Edge-Native Architecture.\\" It is a comprehensive solution architecture that outlines the tools and practices to address the modern requirements for deploying and managing Kubernetes-based edge applications at scale. SENA\u2019s objective is to establish a new industry standard in the form of a well-defined framework that leverages best-in-class security and other concepts, design principles and tools, bringing together the most innovative hardware and software security capabilities.\\n\\nSENA covers considerations across the full lifecycle of edge hardware and software to enable teams to efficiently deploy, provision, operate and manage edge environments at scale. \\n\\n## Kairos and SENA\\n\\nKairos is a core foundation of SENA, providing capabilities in combination with other components across the following areas:\\n\\n### When deploying hardware edge devices\\n\\n- Ease of deployment: Kairos enables zero-touch provisioning through our [Kubernetes Native API](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/automated/) and locally with [AuroraBoot](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/auroraboot/).\\n- Self-coordinated deployment: Enable self-coordinated, fully autonomous deployments with [Integrated Kairos P2P support](https://kairos.io/docs/installation/p2p/).\\n- Flexible deployments: Kairos can be fully customized to meet your Infrastructure needs. Extend [Kairos images easily](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/customizing/), or [build your own using the Kairos framework](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/build-from-scratch/), even at scale [by leveraging the power of Kubernetes](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/build/).\\n\\n### When provisioning the complete edge stack\\n\\n- Ensuring the provenance of the image attestation before deployments and during upgrades via the Kubernetes control plane with [kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/verify-images/). Instructions can be found [here](https://kairos.io/docs/upgrade/kubernetes/#verify-images-attestation-during-upgrades).\\n- Ensuring provenance of the artifacts and comply with SLSA: Kairos releases SBOM artifacts, and builds on Github Actions, allowing you to identify and track components included in the released images with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).\\n\\n\\n## When operating the edge application\\n\\n- Immutable, read-only OS stack: Kairos is a single [container image](https://kairos.io/docs/architecture/container/), [immutable system](https://kairos.io/docs/architecture/immutable/)  which is read-only and cannot be modified during runtime.\\n- Ensuring the privacy of user data at rest and in use. You can [encrypt data at rest](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/partition_encryption/#offline-mode) using the TPM chip and with the Kairos Key Management Server (KMS) \'kcrypt\'.The KMS also accepts only hardware devices with a TPM chip, ensuring onboarding of trusted devices.\\n- Providing the ability for applications to execute in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) leveraging [Gramine](https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine). A TEE is an environment where hardware mechanisms are used to ensure the integrity and privacy of process execution, protecting against privileged (root) processes and physical snooping of electrical signals or devices in the system. You can already run workloads in a TEE with Kairos. For instructions check out [Confidential computing](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/coco/) \\n\\n## What\'s next\\n\\nHere are some of the items in our roadmap:\\n\\n- Static and Dynamic measured boot: We are planning to have UKI-flavored variants to boot the full OS in a single file. This will enable measurement, signing, and verification, simplifying maintenance and management, and leading to true immutability with a reduced attack surface.\\n- Ensuring the provenance and integrity of the OS during boot and runtime. We plan to integrate measured boot and SecureBoot on top of UKI images, integrating with Keylime, enabling remote attestation of system integrity after boot\\n- Ensuring the provenance and integrity of the application stack in runtime. Integration with GSC, [MarbleRun](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun) - to seamlessly run confidential applications in your Kubernetes cluster and running attestation of confidential workloads.\\n- Management of hardware at scale: OpenAMT - Offering ways to automatically register Kairos boxes to an OpenAMT-supported management platform.\\n\\nYou can already benefit from the SENA Architecture today with Kairos and you can follow our roadmap to see what\'s coming up in the next releases [here](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2).\\n\\nStay tuned!

This release is a major release as reflect changes to internal core components.\\n  \\n### What changed?\\n\\nWe replaced the former dracut modules (a set of bash scripts/dracut/systemd services), which were responsible for the immutability management of Kairos, with https://github.com/kairos-io/immucore , a self-contained binary which doesn\'t have dependencies and can run without dracut and systemd. While changes shouldn\'t be impactful for most of our users, as changes impacted only in internal components, we suggest to try the upgrade in a lab environment before upgrading from earlier versions (v1.x).\\n\\nThe 2.0 release allows us to:\\n- not depend anymore on systemd while set up immutability on boot ( allowing us to unblock several stories, for instance create Alpine images with vanilla kernels )\\n- have hybrid images, that boots both [UKI](https://github.com/uapi-group/specifications/blob/main/specs/unified_kernel_image.md) as a single file image, and as well as pivoting (as we are doing currently)\\n- pave the way for things like SecureBoot, Static Measured boot and much more\\n- debug things more cleanly, have a better testbed, and allow to ease out maintenance of the codebase\\n- be a step closer to our Confidential computing roadmap, indeed now you can try out running [Confidential computing workload](https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/coco/).\\n\\nBesides, we have now full SBOM list attached to images, as part of the release process, and `in-toto` attestation, allowing [you to verify attestation also of SBOM lists](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/attestation/), and have full audit of images. We also have integrated `grype` and `trivy` in our pipelines, and as such now releases contains also CVE reports, and finally we upload the generated reports as sarif file to GitHub to have notifications and see with more ease the impact of CVEs to the images. See also our [documentation](https://kairos.io/docs/upgrade/kubernetes/#verify-images-attestation-during-upgrades) on how to gate upgrades and allow only verified images to be used during the process.\\n\\nThere were also fixes to the Debian flavor (thanks to the community for reporting issues!) and now manual upgrades with private registries are supported, too.\\n\\nFinally, it is also now possible to specify custom bind mounts path to overlay on top of the persistent partition, allowing to easily specify paths that you want to be persistent in the system via the cloud config file: https://kairos.io/docs/advanced/customizing/#customizing-the-file-system-hierarchy-using-custom-mounts .\\n\\nIf you are curious on what\'s next, check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2) and feel free to engage with our [community](https://kairos.io/community/)!\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor a full list of changes, see the  [Changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

There are ways to expose the cluster to the world (e.g. like I described [in another post](https://dimitris.karakasilis.me/2022/12/26/self-hosted-ci.html))\\nbut it would be better if only devices within a VPN would have access to it.\\n\\nOnce again, there are many VPN solutions out there, but for this blog post, we\'ll go with [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).\\n\\nSo here is the problem in one sentence:\\n\\n> \\"How do we expose our (possibly behind NAT) cluster, to machines inside the same Wireguard VPN?\\"\\n\\n_\\"NAT\\" is the main part of the problem because otherwise this would simply be a blog post on how to create a Wireguard VPN. There are many nice tutorials already out there for that._\\n\\n## A Solution\\n\\nWhile trying to solve the problem, I learned 2 things about Wireguard that I didn\'t know:\\n\\n1. Wireguard doesn\'t distinguish between a \\"server\\" and a \\"client\\". All peers are made equal.\\n2. Wireguard doesn\'t provide a solution for NAT traversal. How you access nodes behind NAT, is up to you.\\n\\nSo imagine you have your cluster behind your home router (NAT) and your mobile phone on another network (behind NAT too) trying to access a service on the cluster.\\nThat\'s not possible, unless there is some public IP address that somehow forwards requests to the cluster.\\n\\nAnd that\'s the idea this solution is based on.\\n\\n### High level view\\n\\n![Image describing the solution](/img/kairos-over-wireguard.svg)\\n\\nThe idea is almost similar to the one I described [in another post](https://dimitris.karakasilis.me/2022/12/26/self-hosted-ci.html).\\nThe only difference is, that this time we expose the cluster only to machines inside the VPN.\\n\\nPrerequisites:\\n\\n- A VM with a public IP address and SSH access (as small as it gets, it\'s good enough)\\n- `kubectl` access to the cluster we want to expose (it doesn\'t have to be Kairos, even [`k3d`](https://k3d.io) and [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) will do)\\n- A machine to test the result (a smartphone where Wireguard can be installed is fine)\\n\\n### Step by step\\n\\nFrom this point on, we will use the IP address `1.2.3.4` as the public IP address of the VM in the cloud.\\nReplace it with the one matching your VM. We also assume, that the user with SSH access is `root`. Replace if necessary.\\n\\n#### Setup the cloud VM\\n\\nSSH to the machine:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ ssh root@1.2.3.4\\n```\\n\\nCreate Wireguard keys:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey\\n```\\n\\nCreate Wireguard config:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ cat << EOF > /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf\\n[Interface]\\nAddress = 192.168.6.1/24\\nPrivateKey = $(cat privatekey)\\nListenPort = 41194\\n\\n# Mobile client\\n[Peer]\\nPublicKey = <public key from next step>\\nAllowedIPs = 192.168.6.2/32\\nEOF\\n```\\n\\nStart and enable the Wireguard service:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now wg-quick@wg0\\n```\\n\\nAllow binding non-loopback interfaces when creating an SSH reverse tunnel\\nby setting `GatewayPorts clientspecified` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.\\n\\n#### Setup the test machine (mobile?)\\n\\nOn some computer with `wg` installed, generate the keys:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey\\n```\\n\\nCreate the Wireguard configuration. Follow the instructions for your favorite application.\\nFor Android, you can use this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android\\n\\nIf setting up a Linux machine, you can create the configuration like this:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ cat << EOF > /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf\\n[Interface]\\nAddress = 192.168.6.2/24\\nPrivateKey = $(cat privatekey)\\n\\n# The cloud VM\\n[Peer]\\nPublicKey = <public key from the previous step>\\nAllowedIPs = 192.168.6.1/32\\nEndpoint = 1.2.3.4:41194\\nEOF\\n```\\n\\nStart and enable the Wireguard service. If on a Linux machine, something like this will do:\\n\\n```\\n$ sudo systemctl enable --now wg-quick@wg0\\n```\\n\\nOn a mobile, follow the instructions of your application.\\n\\nAfter a while, your client should be able to ping the IP address of the VM: `192.168.6.1`.\\nYou may find the output of `wg show` useful, while waiting for the peers to connect.\\n\\n#### Setup the cluster\\n\\nDeploy the helper Pod. We will use an image created [with this Dockerfile](https://codeberg.org/dkarakasilis/self-hosted-ci/src/branch/main/image) and\\npublished [here](https://quay.io/repository/jimmykarily/nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy). The image\'s entrypoint works with a config\\ndescribed [here](https://codeberg.org/dkarakasilis/self-hosted-ci/src/commit/20d7c6cbf70cd5318309362b0897e6aeb9842b82/image/start.sh#L5-L27).\\nThe image is not multiarch, but there is one suitable for RasberryPi 4 (see the comment in the file).\\n\\nIf you are are going to create a fresh Kairos cluster, you can use a config like the following to automatically set up the helper Pod (make sure you replace the `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` keys).\\nIf you prefer to not have the keys stored on your Kairos host filesystem, you can simply create the same resources using `kubectl apply -f` after your cluster is up an running.\\n\\n```\\n#cloud-config\\n\\nusers:\\n- name: kairos\\n  passwd: kairos\\n  groups:\\n  - admin\\n\\nstages:\\nafter-install-chroot:\\n    - files:\\n        - path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/rproxy-pod.yaml\\n        content: |\\n        ---\\n        apiVersion: v1\\n        data:\\n            id_rsa: the_vms_private_key_in_base64\\n            id_rsa.pub: the_vms_public_key_in_base64\\n        kind: Secret\\n        metadata:\\n            name: jumpbox-ssh-key\\n        type: Opaque\\n\\n        ---\\n        apiVersion: v1\\n        kind: ConfigMap\\n        metadata:\\n            name: proxy-config\\n        data:\\n            config.json: |\\n            {\\n                \\"services\\": [\\n                    {\\n                    \\"bindIP\\": \\"192.168.6.1\\",\\n                    \\"bindPort\\": \\"443\\",\\n                    \\"proxyAddress\\": \\"traefik.kube-system.svc\\",\\n                    \\"proxyPort\\": \\"443\\"\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                    \\"bindIP\\": \\"192.168.6.1\\",\\n                    \\"bindPort\\": \\"80\\",\\n                    \\"proxyAddress\\": \\"traefik.kube-system.svc\\",\\n                    \\"proxyPort\\": \\"80\\"\\n                    }\\n                ],\\n                \\"jumpbox\\": {\\n                    \\"url\\": \\"1.2.3.4\\",\\n                    \\"user\\": \\"root\\",\\n                    \\"sshKeyFile\\": \\"/ssh/id_rsa\\"\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n        ---\\n        apiVersion: apps/v1\\n        kind: Deployment\\n        metadata:\\n            annotations:\\n            name: nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy\\n        spec:\\n            replicas: 1\\n            selector:\\n            matchLabels:\\n                app.kubernetes.io/instance: nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy\\n                app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy\\n            template:\\n            metadata:\\n                labels:\\n                    app.kubernetes.io/instance: nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy\\n                    app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy\\n            spec:\\n                containers:\\n                - name: proxy\\n                    # Change to quay.io/jimmykarily/nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy-arm64:latest\\n                    # if you are running on a RasberryPi 4\\n                    image: quay.io/jimmykarily/nginx-ssh-reverse-proxy:latest\\n                    command: [\\"/start.sh\\", \\"/proxy-config/config.json\\"]\\n                    imagePullPolicy: Always\\n                    volumeMounts:\\n                    - name: ssh-key\\n                    mountPath: /ssh\\n                    - name: config-volume\\n                    mountPath: /proxy-config/\\n                volumes:\\n                - name: ssh-key\\n                    secret:\\n                    secretName: jumpbox-ssh-key\\n                    defaultMode: 0400\\n                - name: proxy-config\\n                - name: config-volume\\n                    configMap:\\n                    name: proxy-config\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the config above is creating a reverse SSH tunnel from the VM\\nto the Pod. Inside the Pod, nginx redirects traffic to the traefik load balancer running\\non the cluster. This has the effect, that any request landing on the VM on ports 80 and 443\\nwill eventually reach the Traefik instance inside the cluster on ports 80 and 443.\\nAs a result, you can point any domain you want to the VM and it will reach the corresponding Ingress defined on your cluster.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n\\n**NOTE:** The SSH tunnel will only bind the IP address `192.168.6.1` on the VM, which means, anyone trying to access the VM using its public IP address, will not be able to access the cluster. Only machines that can talk to `192.168.6.1` have access, in other words, machines inside the VPN.\\n\\n\\n:::\\n\\n#### Test the connection\\n\\n- Try to access the cluster with the VPN IP address (should work).\\n  From your test peer, open `http://192.168.6.1`. You should see a 404 message from Traefik.\\n  You can also verify it is a response from Traefik in your cluster, by calling curl\\n  on the `https` endpoint (on a \\"default\\" k3s installation):\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ curl -k -v https://192.168.6.1 2>&1 | grep TRAEFIK\\n  *  subject: CN=TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT\\n  *  issuer: CN=TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT\\n  ```\\n\\n- Try to access the cluster with domain pointing to the VPN IP address (should work)\\n  You can create a wildcard DNS record and point it to the VPN IP address if\\n  you want to make it easier for people to access the services you are running.\\n  E.g. by creating an A record like this: `*.mydomainhere.org -> 192.168.6.1`\\n  you will be able create Ingresses for your applications like:\\n  `app1.mydomainhere.org`, `app2.mydomainhere.org`.\\n\\n- Try to access the cluster using the public IP address (should not work)\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ curl http://1.2.3.4\\n  ```\\n  This command should fail to connect to your cluster\\n\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nFor non-critical workloads, when 100% uptime is not a hard requirement, the solution we described allows one to use services that would otherwise cost multiple times more by hosting\\nthose on their own hardware. It does so, without exposing the home network to the public.\\n\\nIf you liked this solution or if you have comments, questions or recommendations for improvements, please reach out!\\n\\n### Useful links\\n\\n- [Kairos documentation](https://kairos.io/docs/)\\n- [WireGuard documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/)"},{"id":"understanding-immutability","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/understanding-immutability","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2023-03-22-understanding-immutability.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-22-understanding-immutability.md","title":"Understanding Immutable Linux OS: Benefits, Architecture, and Challenges","description":"In this post we are trying to answer some of the typical questions that help understanding Immutable OSes principles and we will dive a bit in what solutions are out there, and what are the challenges in the field","date":"2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":14.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ettore Di Giacinto","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mudler","x":"https://x.com/mudler_it"},"url":"https://github.com/mudler","imageURL":"https://github.com/mudler.png","key":"ettore-di-giacinto","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["ettore-di-giacinto"],"description":"In this post we are trying to answer some of the typical questions that help understanding Immutable OSes principles and we will dive a bit in what solutions are out there, and what are the challenges in the field","slug":"understanding-immutability","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Understanding Immutable Linux OS: Benefits, Architecture, and Challenges"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Access your home-lab Kairos cluster over a Wireguard VPN","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/home-lab-with-kairos-and-wireguard"},"nextItem":{"title":"Kairos, SpectroCloud, and Canonical Collaborate to Deliver Revolutionary Telco Radio Edge Solution","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/kairos-canonical"}},"content":":::info Updates\\n\\n\\n\\n- 2025-01-10: Added project status for each solution in the comparison table\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nFor years, the traditional Linux operating system has been a top pick for its flexibility and ability to be customized. But as great as it is, there are use cases in which stricter security rules and higher reliability standards are needed. That\'s where immutable Linux operating systems come in - offering a more secure and reliable option, especially in settings where security is paramount.\\n\\n![castle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/226939911-6801ecab-d023-4357-92f2-b782ae086462.png)\\n\\n_An illustration of a fortress surrounded by a moat and guarded by armored knights, with a banner flying the Linux penguin logo, medieval, fortified, secure, trending on Artstation._ Author: _Midjourney AI_\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post, we\'ll be addressing some common questions to help you understand the principles behind immutable operating systems. We\'ll also be exploring the various solutions available and the challenges faced in this field. So, get ready to dive in!\\n\\n## What is an Immutable Linux OS?\\n\\nExplaining the concept of an immutable Linux OS to a newcomer can often turn into a detailed discussion on system internals. However, we\'ll simplify it here as much as possible, even for those unfamiliar with the concepts.\\n\\nFormally defined, an immutable Linux OS (also known as Immutable Infrastructure or Immutable Deployment) is an operating system designed to be unchangeable and read-only. This means that once the operating system has been installed, the system files and directories cannot be modified. Any changes made to the system are temporary and lost when the system is rebooted. Think of it as a snapshot of a standard Linux system that cannot be changed. Any updates or changes are made by creating a new instance of the OS, deploying it, and switching over to the new instance. You can also find a very good writeup by Adrian Hornsby [here](https://medium.com/the-cloud-architect/immutable-infrastructure-21f6613e7a23).\\n\\nIf you\'re already a Linux user, you\'ll know that as `root` (Administrator), you can write anywhere in the filesystem, potentially corrupting the OS portion responsible for booting or management. In an immutable OS, however, any command that attempts to modify the system files will fail, as those files are only accessible for reading.\\n\\nImmutable systems are particularly useful in environments where security is a top priority, such as cloud computing, embedded systems, kiosks, and container execution. Essentially, any environment that needs to scale can benefit from the security and reliability of an immutable OS.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n_\\"But what does that really mean? And what problem are Immutable systems trying to solve?\\"_\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThere are several advantages to using immutable Linux systems over traditional Linux systems. Firstly, there is an additional layer of **security** as it\'s not possible to tamper with the runtime OS. Changes, if accepted, are discarded on the next reboot. This means that if a hacker or a malicious actor gains access to the system, they cannot make permanent changes that could compromise the system\'s security.\\n\\nSecondly, **maintenance** of immutable systems is easier because they do not require regular updates or patches at the atomic package level. Instead, the entire OS is updated, similar to how updates are handled on Android phones.\\n\\nFinally, because the system is read-only, it is more **reliable** and less prone to failure. A declarative configuration model is usually tied to it, simplifying the configuration of the OS when orchestrated with other tools such as Ansible, Terraform, or similar.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n_\\"Right, but how do I manage upgrades?\\"_\\n\\n:::\\n\\nInstead of upgrading the system in place, upgrades are typically handled by creating a new, updated image of the operating system and replacing the existing image, in an atomic operation. This process is commonly referred to as \\"image-based upgrade\\". The image can also be delivered to the end system, but this differs depending on the implementation, and there is no building on the node side.\\n\\n![Upgrade](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/224147132-50d6808e-0a1c-48d0-8f44-627bd0dfa9f2.png)\\n\\nIn contrast, standard Linux systems typically use package managers such as `apt` or `yum` to upgrade software packages in place. This can be a more complex process because the package manager must ensure that all dependencies are satisfied and that there are no conflicts between different software packages. Additionally, upgrades in standard Linux systems can sometimes cause issues if there are conflicts between different versions of software packages or if the upgrade process is interrupted.\\n\\n## Challenges at scale\\n\\nIn standard Linux systems, the package manager has a lot of responsibilities and interacts directly with the system to apply changes. It can install packages, upgrade packages, merge configurations, and generate additional data required for the package. This makes installing software, upgrading, and running a system easy as a couple of interactions away with the package manager.\\n\\nWhen it comes to upgrading an installed system, the package manager should take care of many aspects, such as: correctly ordering dependencies (which may require a solver), verifying which packages are installed or not, which new packages will be installed, and handling file transmission securely. However, as the complexity of the stack grows, conflicts between packages can arise, and the package manager may prompt the user to solve them. This is not ideal for scaling out deployments, upgrades, and cutting operational costs since it exposes the infrastructure to drift.\\n\\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-09 18-25-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/224106950-7d652652-c8e0-4ee4-980d-b057e4af903f.png)\\n\\n_Huh, didn\'t we get rid of package conflicts already? ([screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/z4ld75/this_seems_to_be_common_in_opensuse_should_i_wait/))_\\n\\nTools like Ansible, Salt, Puppet, or Chef can manage and control standard systems upgrade mechanisms without requiring any interaction with each system during high-scale upgrades. In the standard model, clients handle certain portions of upgrades and installations, such as updating configuration files, or regenerating the initramfs. However, these actions could eventually raise the infrastructure drift level, causing a configuration merging to block everything or cause damage to your infrastructure and interrupt services. To avoid such issues, preparing fallback or switching services connections after an upgrade has been rolled out is one way to approach it.\\n\\nTransactional upgrades, are a step toward making standard mutable Linux systems, act more similarly to image-based upgrades in immutable Linux systems. In a transactional upgrade, the new software packages are prepared, usually into a separate partition, and applied after the first boot, similar to how an image-based upgrade works. However, unlike an immutable system, the existing system files can still be modified during the upgrade process.\\n\\nOn the other hand, immutable OSes simplify managing the OS stack by not exposing the node to complexities during upgrades or installation. The image is built ahead of time, using a well-tested, reproducible recipe that does not modify the system itself. The package manager is responsible for preparing a new, pristine environment that the real system will boot into afterward. For instance, immutable Linux OSes that use A/B partitioning create a new image of the operating system with the updated software packages or configuration changes. The new image is deployed to a transitive partition, which then becomes the new active partition. If the upgrade fails, the system can simply boot on the passive partition.\\n\\n## Immutable OS: a look at the current landscape\\n\\nHere are some popular Immutable OS solutions, although this list is not exhaustive. There are much better and updated ones you can find [on Github](https://github.com/castrojo/awesome-immutable). Each of the solutions was created to tackle its own set of challenges, and they differ in their implementation details depending on their target environments.\\n\\nThe following are some of the most popular Immutable OS solutions:\\n\\n- **CoreOS**: A Linux-based operating system designed for containers and cloud computing, which uses an immutable file system called \\"Container Linux\\". CoreOS has now merged with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\\n- **Project Atomic**: A CentOS-based Linux distribution, that focuses on container deployment and management, using a layered approach that allows for easy rollbacks.\\n- **Ubuntu Core**: Ubuntu Core is a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed and [engineered for IoT and embedded systems](https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/intro-ubuntu-core). It uses snap packages exclusively to create a confined and transaction-based system. It also updates itself and its applications automatically.\\n- **RancherOS**: - A Linux-based operating system that is designed to be minimal, lightweight, and optimized for running containers. RancherOS uses Docker for all system processes, and its file system is mounted read-only, making it immutable.\\n- **Talos**: An open-source Linux distribution designed to run Kubernetes, K3s, or other container orchestration systems. It features a highly secure, API-managed infrastructure with automated and scalable operations and is suitable for cloud, containers, and general-purpose environments.\\n- **K3OS**: A minimal Linux distribution designed specifically for running Kubernetes clusters. k3os is built around k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, and uses the immutable Container Linux file system with an A/B update model to ensure smooth and reliable updates. It is suitable for cloud and container environments.\\n- **Flatcar**: A Linux-based operating system that is based on CoreOS and is designed for use in containerized environments. Like CoreOS, Flatcar Container Linux uses an immutable file system to provide stability and security.\\n- **Fedora Silverblue**: A Fedora-based Linux distribution, that uses an immutable file system and a transactional update model, to provide a stable and secure environment. Fedora Silverblue is designed for use in desktop and containerized environments. A nice overview can be found [here](https://www.lifeintech.com/2021/11/19/immutable-os/) or [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/immutability-silverblue)\\n- **Photon OS**: A Linux-based operating system developed by VMware, which is designed to run containerized workloads. Photon OS uses a minimal package set and an immutable file system for enhanced security and manageability.\\n- **openSUSE MicroOS**: An openSUSE-based Linux distributions with transaction-update and is designed to host container workloads with automated administration and patching. Install MicroOS to get a quick, small environment for deploying Containers, or any other workload that benefits from Transactional Updates. As a rolling release distribution, the software is always up-to-date. Server and Desktop have different naming like openSUSE MicroOS Desktop GNOME is Aeon and openSUSE MicroOS Desktop Plasma is Kalpa. Information about MicroOS can be found [here](https://microos.opensuse.org/) and the iso can be downloaded [here](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/)\\n\\nTo simplify the comparison between the different Immutable OS solutions, the following table highlights their key differences and the environments they are targeted for:\\n\\n| Solution | Based on | Update Model | Target Environment | Project Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| CoreOS | Gentoo | Transactional Updates | Cloud | Actively Maintained |\\n| Talos | Nothing | Container image update | Cloud, Containers, General purpose | Actively Maintained |\\n| K3OS | Alpine | A/B | Cloud, Containers | Discontinued |\\n| Project Atomic | CentOS | Layered Packages | Containers | Discontinued |\\n| Ubuntu Core | Ubuntu | Transactional Updates | IoT, Embedded Systems | Actively Maintained |\\n| RancherOS | Linux | Docker for System Processes | Containers | Discontinued |\\n| Flatcar | CoreOS | Transactional Updates | Cloud | Actively Maintained & a CNCF Project |\\n| Red Hat Atomic Host | Red Hat | Transactional Updates | Cloud, optimized for running containers | Discontinued |\\n| SLE Micro | SUSE | Transactional Updates | Containers, Cloud, Edge, General purpose | Actively Maintained |\\n| MicroOS | openSUSE | Transactional Updates | Desktop, Containers, Cloud, Edge, General purpose | Actively Maintained |\\n| Fedora Silverblue | Fedora | Transactional Updates | Desktop, Containers | Actively Maintained |\\n| Photon OS | Linux | Immutable File System | Cloud | Actively Maintained |\\n| Kairos | Any Linux distribution | Immutable File System | Cloud, Edge, General purpose | Actively Maintained & a CNCF Project |\\n\\n:::info\\n\\n_\\"So, what\'s Kairos? What\'s the challenges that Kairos tries to overcome?\\"_\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## How Kairos fits in the ecosystem\\n\\nKairos is a great fit when you want to deploy a Linux system on real hardware at the Edge[^1] or in a datacenter, whether it\'s in your cloud on-premises or in the Edge. Specifically, if you\'re looking for:\\n\\n- Zero-touch configuration and high-scalable deployments. [See how to perform automated installs](/docs/installation/automated/) or [how to create custom appliances](/docs/advanced/build/)\\n- A single distribution center of upgrades across your infrastructure using container registries. [See docs](/docs/architecture/container/#benefits)\\n- Strong security posture, including [online data encryption at-rest via TPM](/docs/advanced/partition_encryption/), Supply chain verification and Service bill of material\\n- Good hardware support\\n- Simplified Kubernetes deployment with [self-coordinated K3s](/docs/installation/p2p/)\\n- [Flexibility in customization](/docs/advanced/customizing/), including fine-grained control over the OS layer (packages installed, versions), and complete support maintenance level by [building images from scratch](/docs/reference/build-from-scratch)\\n- Complete control over your infrastructure\\n- A [community-driven](/community/), [open roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2), office hours, and the opportunity to get involved\\n\\n**Maintenance** - One thing you may have noticed when comparing Kairos to other alternatives, is that it doesn\'t tie you to a specific OS. Instead, Kairos is flexible and portable, supporting all the popular Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora, among others. This, unties you from typical vendor lock-in strategies, forcing you to choose a specific distribution only for the immutability aspect.\\n\\nThe design shines also for its support for **long-term maintenance**. Each framework image released by Kairos allows the conversion of any OS to the given Kairos version, which could potentially enable maintenance for as long as the base OS support model allows. [You can learn more about it here](/docs/reference/build-from-scratch).\\n\\n**Container based** - Kairos treats every operating system (OS) as a set of packages and represents the OS with a standard container image that can be executed with tools such as `podman`, `docker`, and so on. [This container image](/docs/architecture/container/) includes all the necessary components for booting. Kairos components manage all node lifecycle operations, such as upgrading, installing, and resetting. These components are packaged within the [framework images](/docs/reference/image_matrix/#framework-images), which can be overlaid while creating a standard container image. Unlike traditional Linux distributions, the kairos-agent handles upgrades by pulling new container images as systems to boot, instead of relying on the OS package manager.\\n\\nAll installation and upgrades are delivered exclusively through container images, which are overlaid at boot time, eliminating the need for a container engine at runtime. The container image used for booting includes the kernel, initrd, and all other required pieces. This allows for customization directly within a Dockerfile. The container being booted is the image itself, and there is no actual container runtime running the image. The container is used to construct an image internally, which is then used to boot the system in an A/B fashion, without adding any overhead.\\n\\nThis approach offers several benefits, including the ability to verify the image with security scans and treat it similarly to a standard application that can be distributed via a container registry.\\n\\n**Separation of concerns** - The separation of concerns between the OS and the management interface is clear in Kairos. The OS is responsible for providing the booting components and packages necessary for its operation, while Kairos provides the framework for managing the node\'s lifecycle and immutability interface. The relationship between the image and Kairos is governed by a [contract](/docs/reference/build-from-scratch), which enables package handling without vendor lock-in.\\n\\nThis separation of concerns simplifies the delegation of package maintenance, CVE monitoring, and security fixes to the OS layer. Upgrades to container images can be achieved by chaining Dockerfiles or manually committing changes to the image.\\n\\n**Automatic deployments** - To further [automate](/docs/installation/automated/) custom deployment models, the Kairos Kubernetes Native Extensions can be used to create customized configurations either directly from Kubernetes or via the command line interface (CLI).\\n\\n**Self co-ordinated**: [Configuring multiple nodes](/docs/installation/p2p/) at the Edge to form a single cluster can present challenges at various levels, from the network stack (such as assigning IPs to machines) to the configuration of the cluster topology (such as determining which machine will be the master). However, Kairos enables completely self-coordinated deployments, including for high availability (HA), eliminating the need for any configuration templating mechanism or specific role assignments for nodes.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, an immutable Linux OS, provides a more secure and reliable environment than a standard Linux system. However, it may not be suitable for all use cases, such as those that require frequent updates or modifications to the system. Upgrades in immutable systems are handled differently from standard Linux systems, using an image-based approach rather than package-based upgrades. While transactional upgrades in standard mutable Linux systems offer some benefits over traditional package-based upgrades, they still do not provide the same level of security and reliability as image-based upgrades in immutable Linux systems. Overall, the decision to use an immutable Linux system should be based on the specific requirements of the use case, and the benefits and limitations should be carefully considered, something that we can\'t just let ChatGPT decide :wink:\\n\\nImmutable Linux OSes offer a higher degree of reliability, security, and fault tolerance compared to traditional Linux systems. By using read-only file systems, separate update partitions and A/B partitioning, Immutable Linux OSes provide a safe, reliable way to update the system without downtime or the risk of breaking the system.

I know this project is big and that there are many companies building products and services around it, or have an interest in adopting it. So, I was very curious to see what kind of people I was going to meet and understand how Kairos could help them.\\n\\nMost attendees that approached us at the Kairos booths, were hearing about Kairos for the first time, and genuinely wanted to know what the project was about. I feel confident to say this, because we didn\'t bring fancy prizes to give away and yet most of them would happily stay with us for 5, 10 and up to 15 minutes hearing about our features and engaging in conversation.\\n\\n_If you\'re reading this and would like to know about those cool features I\'d recommend going checking out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/), [Web UI](/docs/installation/webui/), [P2P Network](/docs/architecture/network/) and [AuroraBoot](/docs/reference/auroraboot/)_\\n\\nWhen you\'re in the trenches building a product, talking to users or potential users is super valuable because it lets you see first hand, what kind of issues they are trying to solve. I don\'t like building projects just because they are cool. To me, it\'s important that they make people\'s life easier. Some of the folks who reached to us, had clear problems in mind, and they didn\'t shy to make hard questions about the internals of Kairos, our project\'s governance and beyond. I\'m very pleased to say that some of them left the booth with a smile on their face, because they might have found a good fit.\\n\\nWhile I didn\'t get to attend any of the talks, I saw some really interesting topics, some of them from fantastic organizations like CERN!

This release includes bug fixes, small improvements to the Kairos core codebase, and the introduction of AuroraBoot, a tool that simplifies bootstrapping of Kairos nodes. In this post, we will explore how AuroraBoot works and its benefits for users deploying Kairos.\\n  \\n### What is AuroraBoot?  \\n\\n[AuroraBoot](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/auroraboot/) is a tool designed to make the process of bootstrapping Kairos machines quick, simple, and efficient. It is specifically designed for the Kairos operating system and provides a comprehensive solution for downloading required artifacts and provisioning a machine, both from network or manually via flashing to USB stick.  \\n  \\nAuroraBoot simplifies the bootstrapping process by automating several steps, such as downloading required files, verifying their authenticity, and providing a streamlined interface for customizing the installation media. With AuroraBoot, users can prepare the environment for network-based bootstrapping, download the necessary release assets, and also customize the installation media for USB-based mass-installations.  \\n  \\n### The Benefits of AuroraBoot  \\nWith AuroraBoot, users can prepare multiple nodes in a lab before shipment or deploy Kairos nodes in a network segment where workload can already be sent to (running AuroraBoot in an already-existing downstream cluster). Additionally, AuroraBoot offers a simple, intuitive, and streamlined way to deploy Kairos automatically and manually. It makes the deployment process faster, more efficient, and less error-prone. Besides, it does leverage the DHCP server already existing in the network for booting, requiring zero-configuration. \\n\\nYou can see AuroraBoot in action here, with [a full e2e example](https://kairos.io/docs/examples/p2p_e2e/) on how to use it with p2p in Kairos, and in the video below:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Vym18wz9Uw\\" title=\\"Kairos and libp2p\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Improvements to the WebUI for a simplified user experience\\n\\nThe WebUI got several improvements, we have integrated the documentation inside the web interface, and now can be accessed also offline. The configuration schema is validated and a message is displayed if the configuration is incorrect. You can see how it works here\\n\\n[Screencast from 2023-02-21 15-24-59.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/433958/221510120-ce43eb66-e8c0-4b91-885e-3a213fac896b.webm)\\n\\n## Other Improvements in Kairos 1.6.0\\n\\nAside from AuroraBoot, Kairos 1.6.0 includes several improvements and bugfixes, including:  \\n- Integration of documentation into the Web UI\\n- Initial support for schema validation in the WebUI and the installer\\n- Support for Rocky Linux in provider builds\\n- Renaming of kairos-agent and addition of SHA256 signatures\\n- Addition of custom mounts\\n- Fix for DHCP hostname issues\\n- Fix for encryption reset failures\\n- Fix for systemd-networkd hostname settings\\n- Fix for Tumbleweed ISO\\n\\nYou can check the full changelog at:  https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v1.6.0\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nKairos 1.6.0 is a significant step forward in simplifying the deployment process of Kairos nodes. With AuroraBoot, users can deploy Kairos faster, more efficiently, and with less risk of error. Additionally, the bug fixes and improvements in this release demonstrate Kairos\' commitment to providing a reliable and robust operating system for users. We invite you to download and try Kairos 1.6.0 and experience the benefits of AuroraBoot for yourself.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nFor a full list of changes, see the  [Changelog](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

In this post I want to summarize what I presented and share other interesting presentations I attended, which I believe are relevant for Kairos and our community.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## How we build and maintain Kairos\\n\\nI had the opportunity to share about [How we build and maintain Kairos](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/kairos/). In first half of the presentation, I introduce the different elements that make Kairos a great OS for Edge Kubernetes. During the second half of the presentation you will get an overview of how the Kairos Factory works, starting from those different Linux distributions all the way up to producing Kairos core and standard images. Because my presentation took place in the Distributions Devroom, I put some extra emphasis on the challenges we have to be distribution agnostic.\\n\\nThe talk is intended to newcomers, so I made an effort to describe things in a simple and welcoming language. However, I think it can also be interesting for those who might already know about Kairos but wonder how to extend the core and standard images, or simply have a better understanding of how all the pieces interconnect.\\n\\nLike I mentioned, the presentation took place in the Distributions Devroom and we\'re very thankful to them for hosting us. While it was a great experience and the talk seemed to have a good reception, I now realize that the topic is probably more relevant for a different devroom, for example, the [\\nImage-based Linux and Secure Measured Boot devroom\\n](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/image_based_linux_and_secure_measured_boot/), which I\'ll make sure to send proposals next year.\\n\\n## Other talks which are relevant to Kairos\\n\\nThere were other interesting presentations I had the opportunity to attend, which I think are also relevant to Kairos and our community. These would be my top picks:\\n\\nIf you\'re completely new to the concepts of Image-Based Linux, Unified Kernel Image or Discoverable Disk Image, I\'d recommend checking Luca Bocassi\'s talk [Introducing and decoding image-based Linux terminology and concepts](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/image_linux_secureboot_uki_ddi_ohmy/). As someone who very recently joined the Kairos project, I still get a bit lost with all the different technologies used in Image-Based Linux. The presenter made a good job clarifying some of these technologies and how they work together.\\n\\nOne of the key presentations in my opinion was Lennart Poettering\'s, [Measured Boot, Protecting Secrets and you](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/image_linux_secureboot_tpm/), where he talks about Trusted Plataform Modules and upcoming functionality in systemd. I\'m pretty sure there will be some of these features which will be relevant for Kairos sooner rather than later.\\n\\nLast but not least, there was an interesting talk by Gabriel Kerneis about [User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/image_linux_secureboot_ultrablue/). My guess is that we will continue seeing different methods to do and simplify attestation and because one of our goals at the Kairos project is to be as friendly as we can to our user base, then I can only imagine we will end up introducing some sort of remote attestation technologies like Ultrablue in the future.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nFOSDEM is a very important conference when it comes to free and open source software and I\'m very happy that Kairos was present. First of all because I think the work we\'re doing with Kairos is helping solve some of the most challenging issues of running cloud native applications on the edge, but also because as an open source project, it was nice to introduce ourselves to the community there and start a conversation. Expect us to keep engaging with you in further editions of FOSDEM and other conferences!"},{"id":"release-v1.5","metadata":{"permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/release-v1.5","editUrl":"https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/tree/main/packages/create-kairos/templates/shared/blog/2023-01-27-release-v1.5.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-27-release-v1.5.md","title":"Kairos release v1.5","description":"Introducing Kairos 1.5: A Smarter, More Secure Way to Manage Your Infrastructure","date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Kairos","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/tags/kairos","description":"Posts about Kairos, an open-source, cloud-native, and immutable Linux distribution"}],"readingTime":2.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ettore Di Giacinto","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mudler","x":"https://x.com/mudler_it"},"url":"https://github.com/mudler","imageURL":"https://github.com/mudler.png","key":"ettore-di-giacinto","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":["ettore-di-giacinto"],"description":"Introducing Kairos 1.5: A Smarter, More Secure Way to Manage Your Infrastructure","slug":"release-v1.5","tags":["kairos"],"title":"Kairos release v1.5"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Kairos at FOSDEM 2023","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/Kairos-at-FOSDEM-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Media Section","permalink":"/kairos-docs/blog/media-section"}},"content":"<h1 align=\\"center\\">\\n  <br />\\n     <img width=\\"184\\" alt=\\"kairos-white-column 5bc2fe34\\" src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420543/215073247-96988fd1-7fcf-4877-a28d-7c5802db43ab.png\\" />\\n    <br />\\n<br />\\n</h1>\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce the release of Kairos version 1.5, a major update that brings significant improvements to user experience and security.
